# Mean Time Between Failures {#mean-time-between-failures}

Captain Brobarn wasn&#039;t happy. In fact Captain Brobarn was never happy. The command to which he&#039;d been assigned, though worthy, was simply unchallenging. It was safe, easy; anyone could do it, a baby could do it.

Knowing he would have his name forever linked to this event, his last-ever command, didn&#039;t matter, for there was no possibility to show off the accumulated knowledge of a lifetime of preparation and his previous Starship command.

The Ark Fleet&#039;s flight plan had been preprogrammed by the Thorgon ship builders. The only thing for him to do was to monitor the systems with the small, assigned crew. He had plenty of instructions, though not orders; the Thorgons didn&#039;t operate like that, especially given the circumstances.

&quot;The circumstances…,&quot; he said aloud before he had time to stop himself. To cover his lapse he continued, &quot;…the circumstances of our departure weren&#039;t ideal, but we had perhaps better rehearse our arrival; after all we don&#039;t want the chaos of embarkation when we disembark, do we!&quot;

&quot;No sir,&quot; the less-than enthusiastic reply from the crew members on the command deck.&quot;

&quot;I&#039;ll plan some exercises, some drills,&quot; he said, ignoring the muffled groans, &quot;after all, our cargo is rather precious.&quot; At last from this Captain, a fact no-one could deny.

The last remnants of Terran Humanity on board his ship, unimaginatively named &#039;Ark C&#039; after an overlong meeting with the Thorgons, a meeting which firmly discounted the possibility of naming the ship&#039;s after figures from Earth&#039;s history. And the two others, an &#039;A&#039; and a &#039;B&#039; Ark. Each ship had been given a different flight plan due to the linear nature of their construction and the dynamic nature of space, in particular the somewhat unpredictable wormholes into which each ship had already passed. Naturally &#039;B&#039; and then &#039;A&#039; were first to leave, hastily constructed and departing as completed to relieve the pressures at the hastily-constructed spaceport.

&#039;Hastily&#039; is perhaps a little unfair, though accurate. Every piece from the largest section of engine shielding to the smallest indicator lamp arrived just as it was needed, and the whole was in each case assembled by qualified personnel, the best of Earth and the best of the Thorgon sphere of influence.

It&#039;s just that the committee in overall charge of the project decided to miss out the testing phase, and concluded that allocating resources for maintenance personnel to take the trip was not necessary. Consequently, even from the moment the engines first fired, things didn&#039;t work entirely according to plan.

At an average of one hundred thousand people per Ark it seemed a puny effort when weighed against the planet&#039;s population of only four years earlier. Fewer than 0.003% of Earth&#039;s pre-war numbers were given the opportunity to leave, and, weighed against the alternative, even the Humans had to admit it was a super-human effort. This didn&#039;t please the Thorgons much; they had, after all, done the majority of the work, a Super-Thorgon effort.

Now, Captain Brobarn wanted to create a reputation for himself. No, a legacy. Not a record based on the occasional lapses everyone makes, he told himself, but as a hero. A bona-fide solid gold, diamond-encrusted if-at-all-possible, hero. He wasn&#039;t entirely sure that waiting for an event to present itself on a silver plate would guarantee his success, so he spent the time off duty sleeping and examine the ship&#039;s systems.

After a few days he&#039;d made a shortlist of likely candidates, a short list indeed, and then spent time attempting to calculate the best way to make the plan work. It would be nearly impossible for one straightforward reason; he could trust no-one else to assist.

Anything that needed disabling would have to be done remotely, any process leading to failure of a critical component would need to be timed very accurately indeed. In short though, whatever he did could not be linked to him. Any damage inflicted to the colonists would of course be acceptable, provided most survived and made planetfall.

The good news, no monitoring sensors had been installed other than those necessary to regulate the many functions of the ship&#039;s systems. As far as he knew.

The bad news, whilst the outline of his plans would almost certainly require a super-Human effort to fix whatever he chose to break, the element of chance had to be factored into every scenario. He thus had to be within reach of an Emergency Escape Pod, a working, fully-maintained, Emergency Escape Pod. His time was running out.

Brobarn&#039;s character traits all pushed him towards a sensation of happiness only when battling against the unexpected. He imagined he was good at it, being after all a Captain. The occasional negative outcome was to be expected though. This time it must not happen, his plans must not fail, the stakes were the highest he&#039;d ever known. The trait that always troubled those around him, he believed that overcoming the impossible would, as with the ancient saying, take a little longer.

The crew all worked in the one room, so Brobarn&#039;s first command to them was easy, if a little out of character, &quot;Ok everyone, let&#039;s forget about the exercises, I want to know all of the sensors indicating within 10% of expected full-scale at this stage of our journey, at the top or the bottom end.&quot;

He already knew the rear engines and energy systems&#039; reserves would be flagged, the colonists&#039; and crew&#039;s life-support systems would be at the high end of capacity; none of it was designed to last much beyond their scheduled arrival at Planet 9\. The biggest problem of all was related to the Ark Ship&#039;s complexity; chaos, unpredictability… none of it had ever been tested in this configuration.

The numbers came back one depressing report at a time, and even the quantity of remaining fuel indicated the engines were performing more efficiently than expected.

Only one system met his criteria. Every single one of the Emergency Escape Pods&#039; air and blocker system energy reserves were below the expected values for even a descent from close orbit.

&quot;Curse the Thorgon accountant classes!&quot; But this time the bitterness of the thought did not escape his lips. For the first time since leaving the safety of his first ship&#039;s training course Captain Brobarn, one-time Starship Captain, was beaten.
