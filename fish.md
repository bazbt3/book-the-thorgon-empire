# Fish {#fish}

&#039;Little&#039; Timmy Hadron&#039;a training wasn&#039;t going quite as well as he’d imagined it should have been at this point.

The voice came again: “Brace for impact,” and then the floor came up to meet him.

“Aw no. More bruises--”

“At least it&#039;s not as, er… catastrophic as last time,” his dad interrupted, emerging from the observation cubicle. “Then you looked like a fish out of water.”

Timmy, puzzled: “A what?”

“Floundering, you know?”

&quot;No dad.&quot;

&quot;It&#039;s a fish.&quot;

Timmy looked over to the toilet door: “Ah. Yes sir.”

“Breakfast?”

“Yes sir.”

They walked to the common-use room, Hadron senior respecting Timmy&#039;s silence.

“Chef?”, a pause, then “Breakfast of Champions,” another pause then: “Twice.”

“Dad, that&#039;s too much and, do you know, I don&#039;t deserve it right now, not after… Maybe next time. Maybe not.”

“Ah son, just eat, use the time to think where you went wrong.”

“No dad, just the regular breakfast.&quot;

Tim Hadron re-ordered and, as they ate, his son, deep in thought, muttered, &quot;I&#039;m pretty sure it was that first push-off, straight into the Great Attractor. I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s there to absorb rookie mistakes.”

“The Great Att--”

“The crashmat, dad. I rushed the angles again; the last time that&#039;ll happen!”

“Ah,” and his dad smiled, thinking: “We’re there.”

And so they were.

After breakfast was tidied away by the AutoChef they tried again. Not the same simulation, but an entirely different one. It would be pointless having failing candidates repeat with the same conditions, for even at this stage it was important to learn from one&#039;s mistakes.

So Timmy passed this phase. And do you know what? It&#039;s easy when you know how.
