# Reunited {#reunited}

Spinning slowly through both the physical and emotional voids into which he&#039;d been thrown, views alternating between the infinity of space and the Thorgon mothership and its support craft lazily collecting debris from around his crippled ship, he had time to think. Not to plan, but to think. Not how to get out of this mess, not of the future that might be, might have been, but of the last few years with his son.

His command had certainly been enhanced by the boy’s presence, not that he&#039;d shared the routine of decision-making, of course not. It was gratifying that his offspring had that quickness of mind, allied to an aptitude for making the right choices. Eventually. Improving.

His son&#039;s honesty, aside from that one incident with the toilet, was a revelation. At an age at which boundaries were routinely tested… of course he did test, but he instinctively knew his dad’s and the crew’s limits. Tim hoped little Timmy wouldn&#039;t inherit his own shortcomings, the worst of which was that occasionally-dangerous sidestepping of the rulebook…

Roused from his reverie in an instant as the net strung between catcher arms at the nose of the small… no, no human yet knew what the Thorgon ships were. Taxonomies, classifications, no, that was simply too soon.

Whatever it was it scooped him up, and nestled him in an oddly cocoon-like, hammock-like embrace. The motion, though at first disconcertingly soothing, changed suddenly, as the disparity between the direction of his momentum and the ship’s leisurely shift, thrust him against one of the arms. He blacked out, not so much due to the collision but the combination of it, the lack of time to absorb all of this, and…

Jolted back to consciousness by the too-bright lights, the noise, the arms pulling at him, and the smell. Oh the smell! Bitter, metallic, with an undertone of something unlike anything any human had ever previously experienced.

Bang, back to reality. He looked around. “Have you seen…” was met by blank looks, awkward responses by everyone Tim Hadron asked. Not one soul could recall seeing the boy after the Command Module was breached; the speed of subsequent events had simply overwhelmed everyone.

Even V!lum had no answer, which was in itself remarkable. Always the voice of reason though, she ventured, “Wait, our captors may routinely record for later analysis.”

Part-sarcastically, mainly in hope, “I shall ask their Captain then, man-to--”

A siren blared, all the lights came on at once. The door opened, evidently to an airlock and there, blinking nervously, in the lights. stood Timmy.

“Good to see you Dad,” and nervously, “you are wanted, back there. No, I don&#039;t know. They said to look behind you.”

A quick hug and then he looked. Though he couldn&#039;t be sure, the combination of the twin-door airlock ahead with an absence of visible controls on the nearer door, and what had to be an outer hull door behind them, filled him with dread.

To not alarm the others he nodded at the door and spoke one word quietly to Timmy, “Space?”

“Yes dad. I’m sorry.”

Before the Captain had chance to think, his son said “You&#039;d better go, I reckon they want you to see something bad happen.”

Tim Hadron stepped into the airlock. The door closed behind, sealing against the bulkhead with a dull thud. A slot opened in the door ahead, containing what looked like a nose breather. From a sound plate above, “Put it on.” Without hesitation, he did; flexible straps behind the head ensuring a snug fit. “Interesting”, he thought, “are they like us, did they quickly adapt using one of us as…?”

The door opened, slowly at first. Impatient, he tried to give it a helping hand, but even pushing with a hydraulic actuator doesn&#039;t do much.

Thankfully not for the first time in his life, Captain Tim Hadron stepped into the unknown.
