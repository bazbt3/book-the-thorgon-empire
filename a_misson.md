# A Misson {#a-misson}

Snurf took time to think over recent events. Nothing in his time in proximity to The Machine had prepared him for military service. Not exactly anyway. The manouverings around even more complex logistical issues than those from his childhood and a clear understanding of The Creed’s requirements had left him prepared at least for something. His father’s offer of promotion had come to nothing though, being dependent on longer-term performance. Unless some particularly complex logistical need arose it would take quite some time to settle into his new role.

He didn&#039;t like his Vice-Sub-Snarglist. The feeling was reciprocated by his superior officer, a Thorgon who repeatedly bent the rules, even some of the outlying Items from The Creed. He would disappear into his room for entire command cycles, often emerging in a state not suited to the rapid decision making that his status demanded. The worst of it though, from Snurf&#039;s perspective, there was gossip, unsubstantiated rumours, that he was due to oversee the first launch of the first interstellar vehicle completed during the time of The Snarglist, but that he&#039;d suddenly become ill on the night of the launch. Nothing could be proven way out here of course, but the senior officers and crew were wary of spending time with him in case their association with the Snarglist&#039;s death worked against them later.

Snurf had attempted to ask of course but after his superior remembered the time with his father the rudeness of the response, especially the references to his dad&#039;s loss of status, made him give up quickly.

He reached under the desk for the reassurance of his desk ornament, hoping to eliminate the bitterness. Though not entirely successful it at least temporarily diverted his attention to something odd. He&#039;d been lucky to get on board under the weight allowance, and without discarding any item of standard military kit. How odd, given its mass. He&#039;d been weighed before receiving the kit, brought nothing else of his own, and the mothership was more than capable of lifting him, his kit, and any reasonable number of bars.

A knock on the door brought him back to the present.

“Sir, it’s about to begin.”

Snurf checked the timer and, remembering the importance of inspiring confidence, in response: “Yes, it is,” adding, “thankyou. On my way.” He stowed his equipment quickly.

The sub-officer showed no concern, no outward sign of discomfort at the over-familiarity, a breach of protocol; her workload had reduced since the new officer arrived. The newcomer seemed harmless though, not exactly the best attribute for the newest member of the military upper-echelons.

So far Snurf’s workload in integrating himself with the ship&#039;s requirements was high-enough that the importance of maintaining a certain separation, studiously observing others dealing with the subtleties of the chain of command, all absorbed the entirety of his waking hours.

He reached the Command Room, everything bathed in a purple light. His superior stated: “Seconds,” ordered &quot;Sit,&quot; then, after the shortest of pauses: “Observe only, then document, then do the maintenance. Respond.”

“Yes sir,” though his intention, was never voiced. The universe unfolded around them, blacked out, whited out, created checkerboard visual patterns against Snurf&#039;s by-now tightly-shut eyes, it twisted itself, formed and re-formed in frankly incomprehensible ways, then after what seemed like an eternity, collapsed, folding back into a comforting semblance of reality. It took forever, it took no time at all.

Shouted from what seemed a world away: “Coordinates checked!”

Snurf looked up and smiled, no, grimaced with an honest relief it was over, and promptly vomited.

The Vice-Sub-Snarglist looked across from the standing command console and shouted: “Begin!” and, as the crew began the shorter count, wearily, almost as an aside: “Tlur?”

“Yes sir?”

“He’s going again.”

“He is sir.”

And he was.

“Get another cloth…”
