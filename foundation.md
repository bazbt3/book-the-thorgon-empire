A deep breath, held for a moment then slowly exhaled as he looked at the brightly-painted sliding door. All that remained in his mind between this moment and Graduation: to reach down and to press The Button.

Time at The Academy guaranteed every participant, willing or otherwise, at least an edge over anyone unlucky enough to miss out. Many reasons for non-attendance existed, chief of which was the candidate perhaps lacking the right breadth and depth of useful family connections. Exposure to the right stimuli and belonging to the right social stratum were useful, but knowing the right people helped.

There were many reasons for attendance too, from a student’s burning desire to succeed, through family pressures, especially those of following a parent into his or her profession, and all the way to the need of wealthier parents to set their wayward offspring back onto what they deemed a ‘correct’ path. But it would not do to change the institution’s primary selection criterion: an aptitude for both learning and adaptation.

This budding cadet wasn&#039;t entirely happy though. His parents had provided nothing but the best for him, focussed his life on entering this hallowed place. Those energies spent, now came his time to repay their trust, to uphold the family tradition of one entry from each generation. Nagging doubts remained within, but nothing he could focus on or work through.

Nonetheless he entered the Examination Room confident of success. How could it be any other way? His life thus far had been shaped to guide him inexorably to this moment.

Gently curving walls arced round to the left, as near to parallel as regulation construction techniques could make them. At around the midpoint of the left wall a single opening marred the otherwise featureless expanse. Toward this he strode purposefully as the door swished shut behind.

And so there it was, The Button. A control whose singular purpose was to be pushed, or bashed, hit, thumped or otherwise depressed.

So that is what he did, he pressed The Button.

“Aw, no.”

Too-late he read the tiny legend plate below the inviting half-dome:

‘Do not press the button. Instead proceed to the exit door opposite that through which you entered.’

&quot;No.&quot;

Despair, the weight of a world of expectations ponderously settled about his shoulders. And then, as if to lighten the mood, someone turned off the gravity.

Reacting quickly he grasped the inner edge of the brightly-coloured door’s frame and pushed off. Not even he would admit to it being a conscious decision, but would later recount that, during the lazy float along the room towards the exit door, his thoughts were tumbling like himself and very bleak indeed.

Just in time he caught himself, thinking: “Thorgons are not meant to think like that, for independent thought is forbidden, or something?”

He reached the door to a technician’s cheery grin, which failed to lift the spirits of the despondent candidate. “Congratulations Cadet, you&#039;re in!”, a not-at-all expected outcome after a half-minute of disorientation and self-recrimination.

“But…”

“Of course I&#039;m not telling you officially, but I&#039;ve never seen anyone who passed this fail.”

“What?! Did I… Wasn&#039;t I…”

“Yes! Yes. No.”

Confusion, shock, a double-take, twice each. And then, with the Tech’s next words, his world came crashing down. Or rather up to meet him.

“Gravity’s back!” the Tech laughed.

In a heap on the floor, hardly the best place to be as the Commandant arrived to greet the new recruit.

“Heh!”, grinning like the tech: “There are two things that make this job worth doing: your, the average student’s, disbelief; the raw promise of youth; and Graduation Day. Yes, yes, three things. I come to every First Test, and I do happen to like making speeches; people get so emotional, it&#039;s great!”

“But…”

“Yes, you passed!”

“But…”

“Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s normal to feel like this. However, no time to waste, whilst we&#039;ve got you like this we like to begin your orientation. So get up! Get it? It&#039;s a joke. Orientation--”

“Yes sir.”

The Commandant laughed: “Well done.” Then he turned to the Tech: “I&#039;ll leave him in your hands,” and then was gone.

The Tech became businesslike, “Right, time to collect your uniform, the rest of the kit and, of course, your Communicator. What’s your name?”

“Snurf, sir.” And, realising his mistake: “Ag-AckAck Snurf, sir.”

A final grin: “One thing, you&#039;ll already outrank me. But ‘sir’ does feel good. Right, off you go!”

And that was that. In. Expectations at least partially-fulfilled.
