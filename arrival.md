# Arrival {#arrival}

**4 hours to planetfall:**

After manoeuvring into parallel trajectories and matching speeds, the 3 crews started to rehearse the most likely planetfall scenarios.

&quot;Can we see the map of the landing site again, and it&#039;s proximity to the settlement? Can you overlay the anticipated surface tracks?&quot; Captain Brobarn asked.

&quot;We can. Please wait a moment. Transmitting.&quot;

&quot;Looks good, no nasty surprises there,&quot; Captain Hadron said, smiling for the first time in a day.

Each scenario was rehearsed again and again until mistakes were eliminated from the simulations. A vote to pick a path unanimously decided trajectories angled either side of the settlements but ending the closest to them would be the best. Since no-one knew for certain whether the ground paths would end up straight it seemed the most sensible option.

Forward and belly blocker tests confirmed full power could be diverted to both without incident. Ark &#039;A&#039; had a reduced rear capacity but that wasn&#039;t expected to be a problem provided the entry into the atmosphere went as planned.

&quot;We need a command ship. None of us have done this before, so which of us is most likely to succeed?&quot; Snurf asked the question honestly; as the most inexperienced not expecting to be chosen. And he wasn&#039;t.

Captain Hadron solved the problem without showing the extent of his disappointment. &quot;Captain Brobarn is our lead. His mastery of the awful situationâ€¦&quot;

Nothing more needed to be said.

**3 hours to planetfall:**

Captain Brobarn was now linked to the other Ark ship in realtime. &quot;Are the preliminary checklists completed?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Nothing more needed to be said, he now trusted the crews to perform well. Maybe also trust with his life, but old habits take a while to beat.

**2 hours to planetfall:**

&quot;Any out-of-specification readings?&quot;

**1 hour to planetfall:**

&quot;Here goes, good luck everyone! Make sure the blockers are up when they&#039;re supposed to be, people! Let&#039;s hand this over to the machines!&quot;

Being honest with himself Captain Brobarn wasn&#039;t happy with the words he&#039;d chosen. But he wasn&#039;t miserable about them either. For the first time in his professional life he was content.**30 minutes:**
