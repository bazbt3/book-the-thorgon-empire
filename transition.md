The door to the left was already open, a light flashing above. They filed through into a large room uncomfortably reminiscent of their ship&#039;s galley/common-use room. No windows in this, but a large black viewscreen at one end, halfway up the wall. Tables and chairs arranged in lines along the side walls and, between the eating area and the kitchen at the opposite end, sturdy boxes, each taller than a man, and with lifting lugs at each corner. Presumably their stores?

Captain Hadron entered the galley, the last to pass through the ship side and and inner airlock doors, both shut and sealed.

&quot;Everyone, listen!&quot; He commanded. &quot;I don&#039;t know how much time we have before what I&#039;ve been told is an &#039;orientation.&#039; Divide into teams. Medical: check for any injured personnel. The crest, find the refrigerators and the freezers, store the meds and the food, and report on total stocks. Figure out the food heaters once that&#039;s done. Forget about establishing perimeter security, our hosts can deal with that.&quot; There he grinned. &quot;Right, I&#039;m sitting down for a while, get to it! Over to you Number One.&quot;

&quot;Thankyou sir,&quot; said Commander V!lum and turning to the assembled faces: &quot;Carry on. Any questions?&quot;

There was no need, any unlocked doors with storage potential were opened already, the container doors swung aside and their contents in the process of being categorised and put away. So V&#039;lum, content that no further input was necessary, sat.

Timmy didn&#039;t sit. Positioned mid-way along the chain stowing supplies he felt, was useful. He looked across for a moment to his dad, who he found deep in conversation with his First Officer, and then returned to the work.

&quot;What next sir?&quot; said V&#039;Lum.

&quot;Sit and wait for orientation. Timmy thinks it&#039;s going to be something like the first day at school.&quot;

V&#039;lum arched one brow. &quot;Sir? Really?&quot;

Hadron shrugged: &quot;Yup.&quot;

As they watched the Humans, Snurf and Tlur talked. Snurf led with &quot;We have a problem. When, the Vice-Sub-Snarglist awakes from his…&quot; and here he chose his word carefully: &quot;awakes from his,&quot; and here Snurf coughed, &quot;rest, what have we to show him?&quot;

Examining her status screen only to delay the inevitable she tapped her index finger down the list: &quot;We will soon have set the last of the explosive charges to vaporise the Human ship. We have your initial report on the extraction. The Humans&#039; orientation is starting momentarily, and,&quot; lifting her finger, &quot;the outer airlock door will require a final sign-off.&quot;

&quot;But our maintenance… the door is not…&quot;

&quot;Yes. Then we must fix it so that it works as we wish. Now?&quot;

Snurf felt faint, felt the contents of his stomach rising, not that there was anything left so soon after the passage through the wormhole. The only possible response now: &quot;Yes, now. Get the Engineer, we&#039;ll meet at the… we&#039;ll all need suits. And tethers. Oh yes, first show the Humans what they must do to…&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Tlur complied, setting up the prerecorded instructions, and off they went to prepare.
