# Innocents {#innocents}

Tired of their gadgets and gizmos, the children were digging in the sandpit again, an assortment of playthings arranged around its edge. Shaping mountains and valleys, towns and roads, galaxies and universes came easily, as did their casual destruction, such is the limitless imagination of childhood.

Their hundido decided it was her turn to stealthily grab the green alien monster and give it an extensive chewing session out-of-sight of her two-legs friends. Little Tlu worked out that it was Snurf&#039;s turn to mount a rescue mission, and so it was. He ran after the animal but that was no use, its four legs were more versatile than his two, especially when it came to cornering, and especially running around the pomo tree. At 1 year-old still a hundido she had enough experience of their world to know which games worked and which might work, and so created opportunities for them at all times of day. She was lovely, but as mad as a box of, well, hundidos.

Eventually Snurf had had enough running and went to sit by Tlu, pretending to cry. Tlu pretended to ignore him, both knowing that the hundido would return. And so she did. Unstoppable, the licking and play biting began, her tail swishing all the while.

Snurf could no longer pretend to be sad, as usual. &quot;Gibflib,&quot; he laughed, &quot;thankyou for being such fun! But what have you been eating, your breath smells like…&quot;

At that revelation Tlu&#039;s stern expression broke, her laughter making it her turn for Gibflib&#039;s undivided attention. &quot;Ugh, no, bad hundido!&quot; Even at 6 she&#039;d developed an understanding of irony and sarcasm. It was just as well.

And now it was Snurf&#039;s turn to laugh but, always having a more structured approach to play he smiled. &quot;Gibflib, it&#039;s feeding time! What&#039;s that, you want Tlu? Yes, chomp her, though she won&#039;t be as tasty as your… Ok, time to go, go get your bowl!&quot;

The hundido trotted inside and waited, almost patiently, by the cupboard, her cupboard.

&quot;Mother!&quot; Snurf shouted as they ran inside, &quot;Can we feed Gibflib?&quot;

Snurf&#039;s mother looked up from her work and frowned, &quot;Is it really time to feed her yet?&quot;

He peered at the old-fashioned wall clock. &quot;Of course it is mother, it&#039;s always time if you ask her!&quot;

&quot;Ok, you win, carry on!&quot;

The two children took their time opening the food pouch, squeezing its contents into the bowl, and sprinkling a few treats on top. &quot;Shhh…&quot; shushed Tlu.

Snurf&#039;s mother was always busy these days, now his father was away. Paperwork, always paperwork, and shortening tempers as deadlines came and went spilled over occasionally into harsh words. Hugs afterwards and promises it would all be better tomorrow. And it was.

Tlu&#039;s visits broke the streaks of boredom during the extended breaks from school, but he missed his father&#039;s influence. They shared an inquisitive nature, a break-it then fix-it approach to their toys. His father was equally at home in his professional world as with his son&#039;s worlds.

&quot;Tlu, what should we do now?&quot;

&quot;Is it too late for the beach?&quot;

&quot;Mother promised that we could go to the beach tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Great! Which one are we going to?&quot;

&quot;Glarf!&quot;

&quot;Wow! So what should we do now?&quot;

&quot;We&#039;d better put the toys away before nightfall, it goes dark quickly here. Come on, then we can watch the viewscreen. &#039;Planet&#039;s Funniest Pets&#039; is next!&quot;

Gibflib helped of course, she&#039;d eaten her meal and a breath-freshening stick before padding out to pick up the last toy, a squishy ball. One last running-about-like-a-mad-thing game later, it was time to sit and watch funny animals! And then it was bedtime, the frantic changing into sleep suits, a pile of clothes discarded by the laundry basket, rushed teeth cleaning, then the play fight to see who got the top bed. And then they slept.

Part-way through the night they were awakened by at first a low rumbling that shook the house to its foundations. The frequency increased until it reached a scream. And then it was gone. Tlu had heard nothing like it before, and even to Snurf it was new, he&#039;d never before heard a launch in the night. They left the bedroom together, looking for his mother.

&quot;Why were we not told of this beforehand?&quot; she was saying, her face illuminated by her personal viewscreen. &quot;No, nothing,&quot; in response to a voice inaudible to the children. She listened for a while and then, &quot;No! My husband&#039;s job means we have to live here, not that you--,&quot; here her flow must have been interrupted, and she ended &quot;I will contact our Sub-Snarglist in the morning!&quot; She stabbed at the button and terminated the call.

Snurf immediately hugged his mother, &quot;Never mind, we can relax at the beach tomorrow.&quot;

Her face brightened, &quot;Come here Tlu, let&#039;s all have a hug! Should we all sleep down here? Snurf, let Gibflib out too, she won&#039;t be happy about that nighttime launch either. Prepare for lots of hundido kisses!&quot;

And so it was. And then they slept.

The day broke to a light mist. Looking out as she made the window glass clear, Snurf&#039;s mother ventured, &quot;It&#039;s going to be a lovely day today, right children?&quot;

As they washed and dressed the mist soon gave way to bright sun and a clear yellow sky, perfect for a trip to the beach.

&quot;As it&#039;ll not take long to get to the beach we should have breakfast when we get there. Should we take the hundido?&quot;

Both children eagerly replied &quot;Yes!&quot;, Snurf adding &quot;and can we have breakfast at that place up near the forest this time?&quot;

&quot;Yes, let&#039;s!&quot; his mother and Tlu replied together.

The animal always enjoyed herself on walks now, especially after the hundido training classes had relaxed everyone. She loved the wide-open spaces, the freedom to run as fast as she could. The sea took some getting used to, but the two-legs who had brought her along really enjoyed her nose-to-tail shaking after running away from the waves, so it was worth going in.

The three now fitting and checking her harness were confident Gibflib wouldn&#039;t run away, not like last time. Snurf&#039;s father&#039;s patience had been stretched almost to its limit, waiting for her to &#039;stay still&#039; long enough to attach the leash.

&quot;Come on you three, we should go before the lines grow too long.&quot;

&quot;Mother, do you have bags?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

The short walk to the monorail was unusual; no neighbours or vehicles on the streets. It wouldn&#039;t be this deserted even on a Planet-wide Holiday. No-one spoke in the monorail car either, everyone peering into their personal viewscreens. On arrival only the walkers and new families populated the plaza.

&quot;The sea, look Gibflib!&quot; said both children practically simultaneously, Tlu adding, &quot;Come on Auntie Tlerj, let&#039;s go!&quot;

To their surprise the beach was practically deserted, no children or hundos splashing in the waves, no-one building sandforts. The few there were, like in the monorail, deep in concentration, not caring about their surroundings. After a few games of stop the sea, and Snurf saving Tlu&#039;s life from watery sea monsters on multiple occasions, they strolled to the eating place. It was shut! How disappointing, they&#039;d have to leave early and without breakfast!

On the way back home on the monorail Tlu, seeing a school friend, walked along the car to her and asked &quot;Where is everyone today?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#039;t you see the first broadcast today?&quot;

&quot;No, last night we didn&#039;t get any sleep, a nighttime launch woke us up!&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; her friend leaned close and whispered, &quot;Didn&#039;t you see? Oh no, you didn&#039;t. The Snarglist has gone! It said so on the viewscreen, it really did!&quot;

Tlu beckoned Snurf over and asked her friend to repeat what she&#039;d just said. Snurf in turn told his mother, who let go of Gibflib&#039;s lead as the colour drained from her face. The hundido trotted off, looking for monsters to chew while the woman reached into her bag for her viewscreen.

&quot;Oh my Snarglist!&quot; she cried and completely forgetting Gibflib, who was now gently savaging her bag, she went to talk to the other girl&#039;s parents. Snurf and Tlu could hear occasional snippets of the conversation, &quot;last night, from the spaceport…&quot;, &quot;how many?&quot;, &quot;has anyone said who is to blame for…&quot; and &quot;…someone&#039;s going to lose their status for this one!&quot;

The monorail car stopped, they had a mad scramble to get the hundo off before the door override limit was reached. They trudged home in silence, Snurf&#039;s mother tapping away at her viewscreen all the while.

&quot;Children, go play, I&#039;ve an important call to make.&quot;

&quot;Can we put the big viewscreen on?&quot;

&quot;No, sorry, I think most channels are showing bad news today, even the children&#039;s services.&quot;

So, after lots and lots of snacks to make up for the lack of a breakfast they pretended to be at the beach. Gibflib became the tide, she was after all an unstoppable force of nature, and Snurf yet again saved Tlu&#039;s life more than once, this time from sandy monsters and fluffy aliens.

&quot;Children, come inside please. I&#039;ve something important to tell you, Snurf.&quot; When they sat she continued, &quot;Tlu, your mother is coming to collect you, can you get your clothes and your brush and washing things together please?&quot;

Tlu&#039;s mother arrived shortly, hugged Snurf&#039;s mother and took the girl away after the a hurried goodbye and the girl&#039;s briefest of kisses on his cheek.

When they&#039;d gone, &quot;Snurf, we have to move again. I&#039;m sorry but… do you know how your father works for the Spaceport Committee? Everyone connected with the ship&#039;s failure will be moved immediately.&quot;

&quot;Where to?&quot;

&quot;Well Snurf, I spoke to your father and… we just don&#039;t know yet… it&#039;s too early to know. Each of the times before has been after a promotion at work, a job with more status. We could plan. This time though, we just don&#039;t know.&quot;

Snurf nodded but he didn&#039;t really understand. Of course he didn&#039;t, his mother had spared him the detail; some things should be kept from a boy on his seventh birthday.
