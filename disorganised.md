“Timmy, I know, I know. But recording all this will at least give you a better chance than most to swap ships when the time comes,” and he narrowed his eyes, &quot;and you know this already.&quot;

“But being capable seems so far away--”

“So what if you&#039;re not quite old-enough, not quite ready-enough now? Next year, barring the end of the universe, you will be.”

“Universe? Pah! Dad!”

“No, really son. Can you see anything else getting in your--”

Timmy interrupted, sensing a monologue, “I&#039;ll get the folder.&quot;

He placed his hand onto the sensor, unlatched and opened the door, and there, nestled in a convenient carrier, it was: &#039;Ship’s Training Log: Timothy Hadron II&#039;.

“Timmy, can you get mine please?”

“No dad, you know it doesn&#039;t…”, then giggling: “throw over your hand then!”

Joining in: “Pray tell young sir, wouldst thou have me turn off the gravity again? I have a long, bony, dangly thing attached betwixt hand and shoulder. The hand doth not separate! How terribly inconvenient.”

The remaining bridge crew not otherwise engaged never tired of the Captain’s olde worlde affectations. Or so they said. They did worry it might one day extend as far as waving a white handkerchief in times of mild peril…

“No dad.”

Timmy began to transcribe his notes and link his dad’s assessment supplementary notes into the log.
