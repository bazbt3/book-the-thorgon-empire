# Solitude {#solitude}

The technician turned, wiped his goggles and surveyed his work. Not the vast atmosphere creation machine behind him, the last he&#039;d helped erect and test, no. He gazed at the dark clouds above, at the sheets of rain hiding the landscape past the site perimeter, a distance to which the artificial light barely reached. Though his name was on this final day&#039;s work roster, that wasn&#039;t the thing that gave him the most pride, no. He&#039;d helped to build another world.

Sure it had all been a bit rushed and some safeguards had been sidestepped to meet the deadline, but no-one had been killed, the main parameters were all within acceptable limits at this stage. And they would soon be paid.

&quot;Come on people let&#039;s take the photo, I want to go home!&quot; Their Team Leader was, as usual, blunt, a useful attribute at this, the sharp end of the very largest of destruction-construction projects. She set the camera up on the heaviest container, the one loaded with their tools, and again shouted into her communicator, &quot;10 ticks, people!&quot;

They assembled under the ascent vehicle&#039;s wing, the younger team members made the obligatory rude gestures, and it was done. Time to leave.

Save for the departing engineers, surveyors, technicians and construction personnel, the planet was otherwise devoid of life. It wasn&#039;t sterile though, not since anything indigenous had been eradicated. The Planet 9 Habitability Committee had consulted the Humans to determine what organisms would be best to promote Human-suitable plant growth and create an atmosphere uniquely-conducive to Human life. They&#039;d transplanted vast amounts of soil, plants and micro- and larger organisms from Earth to form this new habitat.

Despite all the effort though it remained a work-in-progress with years, perhaps decades before it would be entirely comfortable even in the most temperate regions. Progress was, so far, as-expected. The atmosphere processors, for instance, wouldn&#039;t need to work much longer before their parts could be disassembled and repurposed, as the chemical and physical reactions they had started became self-sustaining.

Patting the vehicle&#039;s hull before they got on board was supposed to bring luck, and whilst it was probably better to rely on the skills of the flight crew, maintenance techs and designers they did it anyway.

As the last boarded, a clap of thunder unlike any previous rent the air around them.

&quot;They&#039;re here,&quot; evidently one of the flight crew, &quot;Just two ships. Not a good start. Our departure window just got moved up. Hurry folks!&quot;

As they stowed their personal kit and strapped in, the Team Leader looked across at the tech, his eyes closed, head back, a half-smile vying for supremacy with the tiredness and, guessing his mood shouted, &quot;We Made It! It&#039;s just as well we&#039;re going home, the settlers are nearly here. You know what, I couldn&#039;t stand this weather for much longer! Always cloudy, always dark, always too-warm, too-wet, too windy, and I miss the yellow skies of home.&quot; And, becoming almost inaudible as the craft groaned and creaked, straining against its lift engines, &quot;And I miss my--&quot;

And then the roar of the jets, the vibration from the craft as it lifted, heading to orbit and the mothership, drowned out any more chat.

The tech looked towards the flight crew&#039;s seats, noted the nameplate above the arch. Even for a vehicle built for the widest range of temperatures and pressures, with a crew to match, the name was odd, not-at-all Thorgon.

&#039;Grendel&#039;.

This world would eventually possess a climate reminiscent of a pre-industrial-age Earth&#039;s. The Thorgons had enough experience in world building to guarantee it. Air, land and sea pollution would perhaps be a thing of this world&#039;s future, but the absence of the influence of hundreds of years of burning fossil-fuels would be absent. An unfortunate side-effect: in the short-to-medium term nothing would smell right to the Humans.

Later, only the occasional visiting Thorgon flight vehicle or monitoring drone would disturb the vastness of the skies, a total absence of multi-lane vehicle highways would remove the familiar background hum, and until the weather stabilised, and until the animal and livestock numbers were great enough to release &#039;Outside&#039;, as it would become known, not even the sounds of the natural, old world passed down as folk memories, would intrude. If it wasn&#039;t for that ever-present roar of the wind and the incessant pounding of the rain it would be utterly silent.

The world was again alone.

The world was ready.
