# Disappointment {#disappointment}

As the show ended a Thorgon crewmember had entered and, to the Humans&#039; disbelief, had begun handing everyone a detailed map of the mothership and their personal copy of The Creed. He had issued one instruction, &quot;Go sleep,&quot; and left.

Captain Hadron issued only two subsequent instructions: &quot;The time is now 22:00 EST, assemble here at 07:00\. And have a good rest, who knows what tomorrow will bring!&quot;

On the way to their sleeping quarters not a single Thorgon gave the slightest outward sign this was anything but a regular event on board ship; barely a glance went their way, requests for assistance were answered fully but with an economy of effort.

All found a place to sleep. The rooms were spartan though comfortable, with similar bunks to those on their old ship, and the nearby washing and toilet facilities had controls familiar-enough to ensure not too many accidents.

The morning after they assembled, most arriving early, and ate breakfast. There were no AutoChefs here of course, but their cooking skills hadn&#039;t quite been lost.

At 8:00 (Earth Standard Time) Snurf entered the place that was no longer a prison, fresh after an uninterrupted sleep period. The crew hadn&#039;t yet had time to swap his rank insignia, but that was inconsequential. What mattered was the time his senior staff had taken to educate the new commanding officer, especially those personnel with more experience in inter-species matters.

&quot;Captain Hadron, please assemble your senior staff and meet me in the Briefing Room. I will take the time to discuss your stay aboard this ship and, briefly, the time that follows.&quot;

When they arranged themselves around the table and before the briefing began, Snurf asked one question. A good question. He nodded at Timmy, &quot;Captain, why is this child here?&quot;

A good answer, the embodiment of simplicity followed, &quot;My son is training to become an officer.&quot;

The Thorgon merely accepted the Hum&#039;s reply and continued, &quot;Let us begin. If you have a question please begin by stating your rank and name. I have a good memory for protocol.&quot;

&quot;Now, you may be wondering why we attacked your ship without any provocation. You might be wondering why it was subsequently destroyed. You will be wondering what is to become of you.&quot;

Mumbled &quot;Yes&quot;&#039;s rippled round the room.

&quot;We disabled and subsequently destroyed your ship because your continued presence at this end of this wormhole would make this ship&#039;s journey home utterly impossible. The timing of its return is absolutely critical.

We brought you to our ship because…&quot; An involuntary shudder at the recent events not entirely hidden he continued, &quot;we find the loss of even a single life distasteful. It is regrettable that some of yours are,&quot; and here he struggled for the right word, &quot;…dead. In any event we are here to talk not about the past but about the now and the future. Your service--&quot;

Captain Hadron interrupted, &quot;We&#039;ve not spent much time working out what to say but as our aim was to return to Earth we should lead with that. What are our chances?&quot;

&quot;Zero. I will explain why to you later, Captain.&quot;

&quot;Why not now?&quot;

&quot;Later, Captain.&quot;

&quot;Why keep us alive if we&#039;re such a threat?&quot;

&quot;You have your uses, as you will see once we reach Thorgon Prime.&quot; At the puzzled looks from around the table, &quot;Our home world.&quot;

&quot;I recall in our first, er… meeting you mentioned restraints. What?&quot;

&quot;Ah. A pragmatic decision; we simply don&#039;t have enough. The previous…&quot; he checked his speech, thinking, &quot;No Snurf, they need not know!&quot; and continued to the room, &quot;We are unfamiliar with your ship numbers, ours are run by far fewer personnel. But I digress, I must tell you more before…&quot; And here his brow furrowed, &quot;before we re-enter the wormhole for the return to Thorgon Prime.&quot;

He continued, &quot;When a newborn Thorgon takes its first breath we say something which is appropriate for you at this, the dawn of your service. Every Thorgon hears this: &#039;Humans, may your observance of The Creed set your path through a life of greatness.&#039; Your lives will be improved beyond measure if you strive to understand its nine basic disciplines. An understanding of the whole is not absolutely necessary. However…&quot;

A pause for effect gives the listener time to mentally shift from passive to active absorption of new facts. Here Snurf hoped the premise was true.

&quot;Now you may think you can simply carry on as Humans. No. It has already been proven that your species must adapt to its new home, as failure to do so promotes discontent; your previous civilisation&#039;s strategies are therefore useless.&quot;

This time a &quot;What?&quot; cascaded around the table.

In response, &quot;You will do well to appreciate these words. This is not a threat. As I said, we know.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; responded V&#039;lum, &quot;Precisely how do you know? &quot;

&quot;I wish to tell your Captain first, Commander V&#039;lum. You must respect my wishes in this. He must then choose how much to tell you.&quot;

&quot;No, it is the very least you can do, tell us!&quot;

&quot;No, the very least I can do is to keep you alive, and--&quot;

He looked down at his buzzing communicator, &quot;It is time, I must prepare,&quot; and left abruptly.
