# Semper {#semper}

The time passed slowly. Fewer-than 5 days from the wormhole to planetfall, but with nothing to do apart from allow the bitterness to grow, Captain Brobarn found the time to reach an all-time high of unhappiness. The crew bore the worst of his bad temper stoically, thinking of the longer-term. A new planet, a chance to shape a world: not everyone gets the chance.

As the planet grew in the long-range optical viewer his mood dropped further. His life had been spent touring the known universe, battling against situations the average Earth-bound would be unable to comprehend.

And on this, his final command, to sit in the big chair only as an observer as his ship crashed into the surface of an alien-made world, Oh the indignity!

Captain Brobarn didn&#039;t often think of anyone but himself.

&quot;How long until we reach the surface of this, this… miserable lump of rock?&quot; he said mournfully.

Ignoring him, &quot;Sir, where are the other ships? We&#039;ve been checking all the sensors and can&#039;t find either.&quot;

&quot;How should I… What?&quot;

Disbelieving, he walked across to the scanner consoles, checked the full communications spectrum. They were right, nothing.

&quot;Crew, I don&#039;t like this,&quot; and, despite the severity of the situation, he smiled. &quot;Continuous sensor sweep, check for debris with the right signature, check for everything, we don&#039;t want any nasty surprises, DO we!

In truth though, he did.

&quot;I want a continuous stream of reports; anything, everything that moves out there I want to know about it. When I&#039;m asleep I want the summary on my monitor for when I awake.&quot;

As the hours passed, as the crew rotated out and the Captain himself slept, nothing much happened. And then, 3 days out from planetfall, something did.

&quot;Sir, 2 energy signatures in our path. Very faint. What should we do?&quot;

&quot;What are they?&quot;

&quot;Too early to say, but what they are not are the other 2 Ark ships.&quot;

&quot;Then we wait.&quot;

And so they waited, there was nothing else to do. The crew kept the data stream coming, Brobarn absorbed as much as any human could, and came to a conclusion.

&quot;It&#039;s not the Ark ships. Their profile is all wrong. What then?&quot;

&quot;We must wait sir.&quot;

And so they did.

He next day brought more data. The crew&#039;s best guess, two Thorgon ships.

&quot;A welcoming committee?&quot; Brobarn guessed, and then, wryly, &quot;I&#039;m off to bed, wake me if they signal us, if anything interesting happens.&quot;

Before anything interesting happened, the ship&#039;s proximity alarm brought everyone&#039;s previous boredom to a premature end.

Half-dressed, Brobarn ran to the command room, shouting even before entering, &quot;What&#039;s happening, why was I not informed we were closing in anything?! Report!&quot;

&quot;Captain,&quot; came the worried, breathless response, &quot;We. Were. Not. Closing. On. Anything.&quot;

&quot;What is it then, what… No. NO! GET THE BLOCKERS UP!! Locate the disturbance, it&#039;s a wormhole and it&#039;s opening! Lock Visuals on when found! Navigation, we need a trajectory to get us out of here! Communication, signal the ships ahead, give them our coordinates and then my outline before it&#039;s too late.&quot;

The crew did as ordered, and just in time. The actinic pinprick of the expanding wormhole as it annihilated what little matter there was close by, it was too bright to look at even with maximum filters.

&quot;Focus sensors round the hole, I want to know which way it&#039;s going,&quot; and, for good measure, &quot;after all, our cargo is rather precious!&quot;

The crew voiced their assent. It seemed their otherwise miserable Captain had hidden depths after all. After all, he had been a real-life starship Captain.

&quot;Incidentally, what options for evasive action have we got?&quot;

&quot;None sir, the momentum of the ship… we only have braking and attitude thrusters now, the acceleration systems are shot.&quot;

Agonising seconds passed then a leviathan of a ship, equalling his own&#039;s size, simply sprang into view. As luck would have it, sensors indicated it matched his own ship&#039;s trajectory, albeit travelling slightly faster.

&quot;Report! Is it, &#039;A&#039; or &#039;B&#039; and can we signal them?&quot;

&quot;Looks like &#039;A&#039; sir, trying now,&quot; and after a minute or two, &quot;maybe we&#039;re too close to the remains of the wormhole? Should we drop the blockers sir?&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Blockers? Yes.&quot; Something, something from his past resurfaced, &quot;Wait, no keep the blockers UP! Why is the wormhole still…&quot;

The wormhole itself answered quickly as, seconds later, another ship blinked into view.

Instantly, &quot;Brace for impact, people!&quot;

This ship wasn&#039;t quite as well-screwed together as the day it left its dock. In fact, coming backwards out of the wormhole, rolling about its axis roughly every half-minute, large pieces being ripped off by forces way beyond the largest ever anticipated by its designers, and with a long trail of fire and debris roiling behind, fire in space; none of it augured well for the future of its inhabitants. In fact, the entire side of the ship facing Ark C at that very moment was open, exposing the life-support chamber decks to the cruel indifference of space.

&quot;Communications: message to Ark &#039;A&#039;, full-spectrum, maximum power, no encryption! Message reads: Ark A, set full power to rear blockers, maximum forward thrust, if you haven&#039;t already. Hoping you can avoid Ark B. And good luck!&quot;

His people did as ordered, though wondering why he&#039;d attempted no message to the Ark &#039;B&#039;.

&quot;People, where is it headed? Preliminary report please.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir. Sir?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You&#039;d better finish getting dressed.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;Some time later, the report came back. Most of the ship was headed not towards Planet 9 but towards the centre of and nominally in the plane of the system. The debris trail would cause problems for years to come if not mapped and cleared. Uncleared, even the slightest interaction from an outside influence would cause an uncontrollable cascade throughout the entire system; spaceflight would be hampered for centuries…

The best possible news, Ark &#039;A&#039; had gained just enough distance that, barring an explosion made unlikely by the &#039;B&#039; engine&#039;s current failed-safe state, it would escape at least the largest masses.

&quot;Thanks, we&#039;d best start the… Do we have the capability to map its trail and constantly transmit to Thorgon Prime?&quot;

&quot;No sir, not yet. I mean, mapping yes. The wormhole…&quot;

&quot;To the other ships?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. We should wait a few minutes for a possible round-trip after our first message.&quot;

Captain Brobarn sighed. &quot;Computer. Record and transmit this. In the absence of any life signs aboard the Ark &#039;B&#039; it is my sad duty to report the destruction of the craft but more importantly a loss of life so far beyond my comprehension that I am truly lost for words. All I can say to the people on board is goodnight, and may your gods go with you.&quot; He paused a second then, &quot;Computer. Ends.&quot;

Then silence reigned for quite some time.

&quot;Sirs, sorry to disturb you, we have a signal from the Ark Fleet, from Ark &#039;C&#039;. It&#039;s not good news. The Ark &#039;B&#039; is lost.&quot;

&quot;What…&quot; replied Snurf, looking nervously across at Captain Hadron, &quot;lost?&quot;

In reply to his obvious confusion, Tlur made it clearer, &quot;Destroyed exiting the wormhole. Both &#039;A&#039; and &#039;B&#039; simply weren&#039;t meant to be there as &#039;C&#039; passed through. The only luck was that &#039;A&#039; seems unaffected, though without communications.&quot;

Snurf responded quickly, &quot;You have autonomy whenever I&#039;m not there. They&#039;ll need us,&quot; puzzled, he continued, &quot;for something. Probably.&quot;

&quot;We&#039;ve an hour before we&#039;re fully-refuelled.&quot;

&quot;They&#039;re coming this way, keep our current schedule, inform me if anything changes. Suggestions for a response?&quot;

&quot;Let them know we&#039;ll match speed, initiate a parallel trajectory, and observe. Ask if they need anything. Does that make sense?&quot;

&quot;It does.&quot;

Tlur looked at her communicator, &quot;Sir, they&#039;re transmitting the path of &#039;B&#039; and its trail. Headed towards system centre. It&#039;ll… it&#039;ll pass through Thorgon Prime&#039;s orbit.&quot; Anticipating the shock, &quot;It&#039;s too early to say what effects it&#039;ll have, should we inform--&quot;

&quot;Yes, maximum power.&quot;

Captain Hadron broke into the conversation, &quot;How many on board?&quot;

&quot;About 87,000.&quot;

&quot;All gone?&quot;

&quot;It seems so. I&#039;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Who&#039;s in charge of the remaining Arks?&quot;

&quot;&#039;A&#039; is Commander Franck, &#039;C&#039; is Captain Brobarn.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Brobarn eh? What about &#039;B&#039;?&quot;

&quot;I… I don&#039;t know.&quot;

&quot;Do you know how long it&#039;ll take when we match speed? I assume the Ark ships are slower?&quot;

&quot;A day before we&#039;re alongside, as it were, then the same time in theory, provided there aren&#039;t more problems.&quot;

&quot;2 days, plus or minus?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Can you send a message to Captain Brobarn from me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;

&quot;Tell him… tell him, &#039;Safe journey, well done.&#039;&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot;

&quot;He&#039;ll understand. We have some history you see, he--&quot;

&quot;It will be done.&quot;
