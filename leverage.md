Snurf hefted the bar. Triangular in section, smoothed-off corners of course, intentionally made difficult to displace, and with a mass and colour suggesting tungsten. A potentially useful weapon, though the chances of him using it, sat behind this desk, tended towards zero.

Etched on one face, that seen by visitors to his office: “Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist”.

The side almost-always aligned away from visitors, his title: “Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist” and, in a shallow, almost imperceptibly-tiny font height below, his full name: “Ag-AckAck Snurf.” Only a few had ever seen this side of the ornament and of the official, and those either owed Snurf their lives or paid for past transgressions of The Creed with favours equal to the severity of their flaws. The problem with the personalisation was straightforward; any personality injected into any aspect of officialdom was energetically proscribed, against The Creed.

On the base though, something entirely different; something no other Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist would ever, had ever dared to consider. Something that, if uncovered by anyone but Snurf himself, would bring instant demotion without a committee stage due to its extraordinarily unpatriotic ambition. It was: &#039;Snarglist Snurf&#039;.

Even thinking of it now his mind automatically tracked down the mental list he&#039;d made over the years to… &#039;Item 792 of The Thorgon Creed: “Independent thought is contagious. You must stop immediately.&#039;

Usually, the admonition was enough to stop young Thorgons in their tracks. And whilst so it was in Snurf’s youth, this was in every sense a different age.

He snorted at the memories, then caught himself. No, it would not do to be seen like this; the time was not yet right. He looked down his schedule, wishing for a stronger motivation to sort through the stack of papers on his desk. And then a noise outside, a reflexive motion towards his bar. Too late to hide it now!

“…it should be entertaining. I&#039;ll let you know what he says.” The Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist entered without a signal. “Ag-AckAck, how would you respond to my offer of a promotion?”

“What is the catch?”

“For me? None.”

“For me?”

“Ah. Do you like to travel?”

Snurf looked at his superior and, despite his years of training to avoid such things, the dark thoughts reappeared. Quelled quickly, he said “No. Of course not.”

“Good.”

Snurf awaited the inevitable outcome.

“Good,” Snurg continued absentmindedly, now peering at the desk ornament: “very good.”

Snurf now needed a diversion. Quickly, perhaps too quickly: “When will I leave? Where will I--”

“Right away. You seem, what&#039;s the word…?” Snurg paused, searching. At length, his eyes closed as he remembered a word from his past, “Emthusiastic?”

“Yes sir, Enthusiastic, at least that&#039;s what I&#039;ve been told.”

“Yes,” and, half as an aside, “what will you need?”

This time Snurf paused, unsure exactly where this odd conversation would end up. “I shall need time to clear my office. I--”

“Why? Do you perhaps have anything of, oh what&#039;s the word, Semtimental value?”

“Sentimental sir, at least that&#039;s--”

&quot;It doesn&#039;t matter. Would you like to know where you are being moved to?&quot;, and Snurg&#039;s gaze again shifted to the desk.

The response again came quickly, &quot;Yes, I would. If I had a choice I&#039;d like an assignment in--&quot;

The Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist interrupted yet again, &quot;I researched your time at The Academy. You did well, not spectacularly well but that&#039;s forgivable. The range of your studies though was quite impressive, a good preparation for any career serving Thorgon. Particularly suited to--&quot;

It was Snurf&#039;s turn to interrupt here, &quot;With respect sir, this career was not my choice, if I&#039;d had a choice I--&quot;

“Don&#039;t,” Snurg said. “I know you are perhaps about to say something typically odd, forbidden even, or may be thinking about asking awkward questions. Either way I know I will not like it. After all…” and here he smiled and paused for effect…

Snurf knew now, beyond doubt, what was next.

“…after all, I am your father.”Shaking his head, &quot;Dad, please. So where am I going?&quot;

&quot;Somewhere you can regain your sense of humour would be nice, but I have the feeling you&#039;re going to be overwhelmed, at least at first. Never forget what I said when you got your copy of The Creed.&quot;

Snurf&#039;s brow furrowed. There was something big coming up; his dad otherwise never used that phrase.

&quot;This time you&#039;d better explain dad, you&#039;re being even more obtuse than usual. What is it?&quot;

&quot;I cannot tell you. Even though I know you&#039;ve disabled the recorder in this room I cannot. If you knew you wouldn&#039;t--&quot;

The Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039;s communicator signal interrupted his flow.

&quot;I must go. I have to let my superiors know you have accepted the mission.&quot;

&quot;Mission?&quot;

&quot;Assignment.&quot;

Snurf nodded, knowing he was not going to like this, not one bit; his father very rarely used the word &#039;mission&#039;.
