## A guide to the book {#a-guide-to-the-book}

This is not a manual for Human-Thorgon first encounters (or any others if it comes to that!) It&#039;s a science fiction story I would like to be read. That bit&#039;s not rocket science (I don&#039;t have the qualifications!)

### History {#history}

The now-defunct App.net (ADN) social network became, for me, a cradle for creativity. Its weekly #WednesdayChallenge 256 character (a single-post) short story writing challenge restarted and energised my imagination.

Prior to starting the book I spent time outlining a summary (an FAQ if you like) of the Thorgon universe, partly from memory, partly from the archive of my ADN posts. It&#039;s all stored in a &#039;repository&#039; at [https://github.com/bazbt3/the_thorgon_empire](https://github.com/bazbt3/the_thorgon_empire) - a site usually used by coders for its version management architecture.

The FAQ is by now lagging behind my imagination. This is actually a good thing, it keeps me from straying too far from the vision ofâ€¦

### Acknowledgments {#acknowledgments}

@mlv started this saga off for me by writing ADN posts about a potentially evil race called the Thorgons. &#039;Evil?,&#039; I thought. I&#039;m not so sure. He thus became the Human versus my inadvertent adoption of the Thorgon. As the creator of the Thorgon universe, he is the ultimate decider of things; for instance I&#039;m a fan of Star Trek, would use its terminology throughout. This work is entirely<sup><sup id="344322933859850-footnote-ref-2"><a href="#344322933859850-footnote-2">[1]</a></sup></sup> the result of his inspiration.

@schmidt_fu (unwittingly?) provided the inspiration to start this, with a pnut.io social network post about budget cuts vs the survival of the remnants of the Human race.
