# Theatre {#theatre}

Only at the last plaza had they weakened and bought drinks from the ever-popular kiosk. Standing in a line and sandwiched between two loud families and their bratty children on the way home from the beach didn&#039;t do much for this expectant mother&#039;s temper. The drink was welcome though, especially when, as they sat for a short while, her husband rolled his unopened bottle across her forehead. Though the chilled surface didn&#039;t soothe her nearly enough, his attention was welcome.

The evening breeze heading towards the sea became cooler; they&#039;d needed a break from the heat of the earlier sun, and from the effort of walking from the first plaza. Though it had been only three hours it felt as though they&#039;d been walking all day; but custom meant it had to be done the correct way.

The sky had paled from its earlier deep yellow as the sun dipped towards a horizon hidden from view by a screen of trees and the city beyond. The clouds just starting to form offshore were usually a sign of at least some rain along the long sweeping bay, and with luck showers would come later, or on the way home.

&quot;How long does this take?&quot; she asked, mainly to break the awkward silence as they continued to trudge northwards. Though countless couples must have endured the same over the millennia, the history and the traditional perspective meant nothing to her.

Still not cool enough to think properly he started to respond, &quot;300 days, plus or minus--&quot;

Impatient, she interrupted, &quot;Plus or minus?!&quot;

&quot;It is not an exact science as you know, it is why we come here. I wonder what--&quot;

&quot;I meant the walk of course. You have become sloppy, you have been subjugating those, those hamans for too long!&quot;

&quot;Humans.&quot;

By now incredulous, &quot;Correcting my pronunciation at a time like this is completely--&quot;

Tiring of his wife&#039;s mood swings, it was his turn to interrupt, &quot;So why did you ask?&quot;

&quot;We must visit Glarf Forest. It is our Time,&quot; and, remembering the other thing, &quot;well afterwards, after we deliver the precious packet.&quot;

&quot;What kind of answer is… Oh, precious is it now?!&quot;

“It is your duty to first complete the task commanded by Tourism Section Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist.”

“Yes, of course.”

“Show me the directions again.”

“Yes, of course.”

Tlerj read it out loud, primarily to deflect her thoughts from the increasing discomfort and thoughts of the upcoming pain:

1.  Head to the Glarf Forest Gate, but do not pass through unless you absolutely must,
2.  Turn left to the Argle Theatre. If the waiting line is excessively long use your passes to gain entrance at the rear,
3.  Pass through the galley and up to the viewing gallery. Observe the disgusting mass of Humans spread before you.

The path wound on and up, the silence lengthened until, the first to spot it, Snurg said “Well, there’s the forest gate, and I can smell… What is that?”

Sniffing, “We are not paid enough for this,&quot; and, on turning the document over a surprised, “Oh, a map!”

“Heh! Sophisticated for our Cartographic cadre, that,” Snurg laughed.

“Remember our purpose here!”, laughing despite her irritation.

“As if I could forget, I mean, look at you!”

Grimacing, “What?!”

“Radiant, my dearest.”

Wearily, “Enough husband, let us see your beloved hamans.”

“Hu…”

“No, DON’T!”

“We&#039;re here.”

And so they were. The southern tower of the sweeping expanse of the theatre, curving towards the sea at both ends, each tower topped with an illuminated cupola to match the forest gate&#039;s, met them out of the mists. The sight, at least according to the guidebooks, was always worth the trek. Pure propaganda.

The line was, of course, long. It was always long, the committee overseeing The Guardians of the Experience ensured it. Time to relax, time to prepare, time to ready for The Time.

Snurg moved to stand in line, remaining despite his recent doubts a product of the many centuries the Thorgons had lived within the comfort of The Creed.

Tlerj&#039;s irritation grew again, “No. We follow the directions,” and so they did, all the while trying to project a confidence they didn&#039;t feel, a we&#039;re-meant-to-be-here attitude. They walked around the northernmost tower, then to the rear of the theatre, offered their passes to the security scanners, then passed through the doorway.

Oh the heat, it beat at their faces stronger than the earlier afternoon sun; the noise assaulted their ears, the slamming of oven doors, clanging of ladles in just-emptied pans; and the indescribable smells, an intermingling of Thorgon foods and something utterly repulsive, it all beat at their senses!

An inadvertent glance over at the ’Human’ board indicated something unfamiliar to the pair. Obviously unfamiliar. It read, ’Thorgon Green (don&#039;t forget the stronger additives)’

Shuddering at the implications, of which they&#039;d naturally heard wild rumours, they passed through what seemed an endurance test to her, and opened the door at the far end of the room.

“Stairs?! What kind of idiot expects me to climb stairs so close to…” Yet they climbed, eventually reaching another door through which a cool breeze blew, very welcome after the torment of the galley.

And there they were, the other side of a mesh containment screen. Fewer than the couple had imagined from the publicity materials, but more than even Snurg had previously seen in one place.

“Oh my Snarglist, it&#039;s full of Humans! Why were we chosen for…” she wailed, for this was after all her first exposure to the species.

“I don&#039;t know, I really don&#039;t.”

“You must have done something bad in a previous life.”

“You must not speak so, it is forbidden.”

She winced: “It is time, we must go, we must go now, that, that… it is turning my stomach.”

“Why were we asked to deviate from The Plan everyone else must follow at this special time?”

“Now!”

“But what about our visit here just--”

“No questions, we must go NOW!”

The other viewers looked around at the sudden noise, but all were there for one reason, and only one reason; the smells from below were a catalyst, an accelerant for the the start of the Birthing process. The Humans, though an inconvenience to the Thorgons, had a use after all. If only they knew why they were…

As directed by his superior Snurg dropped the packet into the tub used for offerings to the Guardians. Donations had always been good, the birth rate, though not increasing, remained manageable and, though The Bureaucratic Machine would probably intervene if standards slipped, the Births Subcommittee had so far indicated their unwillingness to interfere here.

The walk to the exit, this time leaving via the front of the building, and then to the forest, passed uneventfully. No-one asked for passes, the purpose of the couple’s visit obvious to even an untrained eye.

Far-enough in to avoid the daylight, close-enough that the mother-to-be inflicted little lasting damage to the arm of the father-to-be, they stopped. Settling into a pool, as custom dictated, seemed natural; this was after all a lifetime in preparation.

No, dear reader, now is not the time to detail the manner of birth of a Thorgon child. Suffice it to say the bandages on a male’s arm for the days after, the later evidence of scars, both are testament to the pain shared by both male and female, pain endured during an entirely painkiller-free delivery. The Thorgons use pain suppressants at other times, but by necessity childbirth isn&#039;t one. The Creed is quite explicit there.

Now resting by the side of the pool on towels provided by the Guardians the baby looked up at his new parents, an oddly inquiring expression playing across his shiny face.

“What shall we call him?”

“I like ‘Snarf’ or ’Snarg’, but we&#039;ve had this conversation tens of times before, enough that I&#039;m uncertain if my input is appreciated.”

“You can&#039;t have those two, father has never forgiven you for the…”

“And your Grandfather Snarg doesn&#039;t think I&#039;m--”

The baby broke wind and simultaneously filled the towel wrapped inexpertly around him. As it escaped the father sniffed the air and, through tears and retching shouted, “Oh great Snarglist, what a smell!”

“Oh, wipe it up and get over it, it&#039;s not going to be the worst…”

Through tears: “Snurf it is then.”

Tlerj, though not exactly triumphant grinned, “Yes, I knew you&#039;d come around eventually.”

Snurg straightened up, winced against the pain and formally greeted his offspring, “Welcome to Thorgon, Ag-AckAck Snurf, and may your observance of The Creed set your path through a life of greatness.”

This last was a ritual welcome, said by Snurf in case anyone was within earshot. The trees here had ears you know. Literally. Carved into each trunk, a reminder, if ever one was needed, of the always-present need to follow the ancient customs.

The baby looked up again, smiled, and promptly vomited.

“Get another cloth…”
