# Speculation {#speculation}

&quot;What could he possibly have meant?&quot;, &quot;Zero chance of seeing Earth?&quot;, &quot;They know all about Humans already?&quot;, &quot;What the…&quot;, the words tumbled out. They talked amongst themselves for a while, though no consensus was reached. Having no answers the Captain simply let the words come. Eventually though, he said simply, &quot;Enough talk people. It seems to me we should wait this out, and not do anything, um… to make things more difficult than they already are. I&#039;d better go to see their Captain, he did seem to say he would only tell me about Earth, and how and what they know of us.&quot;

The words came again. Holding up a hand to stem the tide, &quot;I&#039;ll see what he has to say.&quot; He stood and strode out.

On the walk to the Command Room he realised he didn&#039;t actually know where the Captain would be. No-one stopped his progress until he reached the door. A handprint sensor stared at him. He stared back for a moment, looked for a button to press, found none, so knocked. And waited. Ship&#039;s doors don&#039;t transmit the forces from knuckles though, so he had to wait for a while. Eventually though, just as he was about to find a crew member, or to give up, he placed his hand on the sensor. The door opened, &quot;How?!&quot;

Tlur looked across and motioned him to a chair next to the door. &quot;We took your handprint as you entered that first time, as you got the mask, incidentally a very useful distraction, it is utterly useless.&quot;

He sat, mind racing, still surprised by his ease of entry, and waited for… for what, he really didn&#039;t know.

Snurf pulled himself away from his deliberations, &quot;Good morning Captain. We are currently making preparations to return to Thorgon Prime. Would you like to stay here until we arrive?&quot;

&quot;I… I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;d like to speak to my crew before it happens.&quot;

&quot;No need, we are informing them right now. First Officer, take over.&quot;

Hadron continued, &quot;Ah. Ok. I… I can see you are busy Captain, so I cannot speak about… Is there anything I can do here?&quot;

Tlur replied, &quot;No, you will almost certainly get in our way if you try. You can observe if you wish, or leave.&quot;

&quot;Can I ask you about--&quot;

&quot;No, you cannot.&quot;

&quot;How long until you open the wormhole and we--?&quot;

&quot;Soon. Our Navigation Officer is checking our position, attitude and speed now. Our Engineer has confirmed we have enough stored matter to expand the opening and also enough energy available to protect our passage.&quot; A lopsided grin, nodding in the direction of Snurf, &quot;Enjoy the ride.&quot;

Snurf looked worried. Returning home as Vice-Sub-Snarglist, the inevitable inquiry, the committees… it was nothing compared to the misery he knew was coming. He hated the wormholes. Hated.

The Human Captain was talking with Tlur, and both looked across. He smiled weakly, a vain attempt to lift his mood and inspire confidence. He failed.

Hadron nodded, adopted his &#039;serious&#039; expression, &quot;Not a fan of the kaleidoscopic effects and being ripped apart and badly put back together?&quot;

&quot;Is anyone?&quot; Snurf responded, feeling weak already.

&quot;Have you tried alco--&quot; and the universe unfolded around them, blacked out, whited out, created those patterns against Snurf&#039;s tightly-shut eyes, it twisted, formed, re-formed, collapsed, and eventually folded back into reality. It took forever, it took no time at all.

Shouted from what seemed half a universe away: “Coordinates checked!” Nearly home.&quot;

Snurf looked up, grimaced, straightened to try to fool himself into thinking as he was now in charge it would look bad if he… and promptly vomited. This time though he&#039;d brought a towel along for the ride.
