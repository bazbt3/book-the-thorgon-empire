Snurf resolved to speak to Captain Hadron. He cleaned himself up, changed into a fresh duty uniform and took a deep, deep breath. Putting this off would only make things more difficult in the long term, it would be better to do it now, to keep all the negative stimuli close together. Knowing what he had to tell the Human, something particularly troubling, he asked the Security Officer to monitor his discussion via a dedicated link into his communicator, and to be ready to intervene should things escalate.

He checked the ship&#039;s Machine, located the the Captain in his quarters, and set off. He found the door open, the Human discussing the events of the last couple of days with his son. Rather than simply walk in he coughed and, &quot;Captain? Indeed to speak to you, we have unfinished business.&quot;

&quot;Come in, take a seat.&quot;

&quot;Can I--&quot;

&quot;My son stays,&quot; Hadron senior smiled, &quot;please begin. I suspect I&#039;m not going to like it much though.&quot;

&quot;How long have you been away from your home world, Earth, Terra, what do you prefer?&quot;

&quot;Earth is fine. We&#039;ve been away for… how long Timmy?&quot;

&quot;Nearly four years dad.&quot;

The Thorgon took a deep breath, closed his eyes and started, &quot;You picked the wrong wormhole. The one we found you at led of course directly to the Thorgon system. The remainder of our fleet is scheduled to reach Earth during this Command cycle.&quot; Rather than wait to let the Humans absorb this news he continued, &quot;Once there they will collect all our planetary resource extraction personnel, terminate mining operations, collect any un-transported cargo, and then return to our homeworld. It will take only about twenty Command cycles to complete.&quot;

Both Hadrons&#039; mouths flapped uselessly so Snurf continued, &quot;We Thorgons started operations there fewer than 4 years ago. Four of your planet&#039;s years.&quot;

Stunned, Tim Hadron couldn&#039;t speak. Timmy though ventured a question, &quot;What about the people?! I…&quot;

Snurf waited what he judged to be a respectful time before replying, &quot;Those who we could, they&#039;ve all gone, we had time to--&quot;

&quot;What, gone, what kind of monsters are you!!&quot; The Captain interrupted. He rose to attack the Thorgon but Timmy stood between them.

&quot;No dad, let their Captain finish. Please.&quot;

His imploring gaze succeeded in calming his father&#039;s rage, at least for now.

Snurf could empathise with the Human, to a point. Nothing bad had ever happened to Thorgon, nothing existed in the the entirety of the Historical Record. His experience was at a much smaller scale. When Gibflib had to take that last trip to the medics he went along too. Not because it was his duty to, but as her friend. He held her paw and looked into her eyes as the anaesthetic was given, and waited with her until he was certain it was all over.

His expression must have changed because Timmy saw something behind the diplomat&#039;s mask, but the Thorgon couldn&#039;t allow his guard to drop far, not here, not now.

He shook his head to clear it and began to explain how they&#039;d arrived at the planet years before, and chosen it as a likely candidate for mining operations. After a periodic drone reconnaissance mission detected an increase in radiation a more detailed survey was carried out.

It transpired that a charismatic but completely insane leader had destabilised a number of economic systems with the unfortunate effect, not predicted by the man himself, of a number of minor regional spats spilling over into international conflict. Though he was removed from power due to, of all things, lying about his expense claims, the damage was irreversible. Nuclear weapons were deployed to sensitive areas and, in response to poorly-timed terrorist incidents, launched. The loss of life was…

Timmy said nothing even as Snurf finished. Tim Hadron said not much, just, &quot;What happened to the people?&quot;

&quot;We sent Ark ships.&quot;

&quot;What, like in the movies? Really?! How many?&quot;

&quot;Three.&quot;

&quot;Three, is that all?!&quot;

&quot;Dad…&quot;

The room fell silent.

Snurf waited until he was sure the Captain would remain mute before deciding to leave. At the door he beckoned to the young man and spoke softly, &quot;Timmy, when your father is ready to talk, please let him know I will attempt to answer his questions. I recognise it can&#039;t be easy. Was he born there?&quot;

&quot;Yes Captain, he, I…&quot;

At that they parted.

True to his word, when Hadron was ready Snurf made time. In truth he was glad of the diversion; there wasn&#039;t much for him to do until they neared his homeworld. The routine established for planetary rendezvous was handled by the ship&#039;s Machine, the rest by his crew. The right magnitude and length of engine burn at the right time, centres of mass shifted to within acceptable limits, contingency energy level projections monitored… and the recovery from his wormhole trip seemed to be taking longer than the last.

&quot;Thanks for coming to see me Captain. What would you like to know?&quot;

&quot;Would &#039;Everything&#039; be impossible?&quot;

&quot;Well, it might take a while longer…&quot;

&quot;Let&#039;s start then.&quot;

So they talked.

It turned out that not everyone wanted to leave Earth, which might seem a little odd given the Thorgon&#039;s wide-ranging exploitation of the plant&#039;s easiest-to extract metals, minerals, even fossil fuels. No-one had yet calculated the effects of this by-necessity asymmetric removal of mass, to determine its level of Sol-orbit destabilisation. No-one thought it would end well and in fact, some didn&#039;t care when, or if, it would end badly.

The Thorgons had imposed one condition. Just one condition in return for removal of large numbers of Earth dwellers, their livestock and other dependent organisms from a doomed environment, to be resettled on an Earth-like planet outside Thorgon Prime&#039;s orbit, a planet close to the completion of its loosely-termed &#039;habitable&#039; 1st-stage terraforming operations. The condition was a small price to pay, and yet bigger than most could bear.

The condition imposed In exchange for their altruism (and, of course the ores and other things) in giving Humanity, no these Humans this fresh start?

A small thing really.

None of the accumulated wisdom of Humanity written down throughout the ages would be allowed on board; none of the sciences, no scholarly articles nor even the most outlandish pseudo-scientific ramblings, and of course none of the applied sciences. None of the arts, whether painted or sculpted or written out as poetry or prose. None of the religious texts, tracts or iconography. No recorded music or song. No paper-based or electronic documents or the means to store them; none of it would accompany them to the new world.

The reason for the decision was as pragmatic and sensible as the Thorgons either when resolving or when initiating conflict. Stability. Their reasoning was impeccable, given the recent carnage across Earth. It would of course take a few generations to work out but Thorgons are, as a whole, patient. So whilst most Humans didn&#039;t like it one bit, a trade-off too awful to even contemplate, enough did.

Bravery didn&#039;t enter the minds of those leaving, and no-one called them brave. Idealism wasn&#039;t much in evidence either, and so no-one called them idealistic. Choices were made but it began and ended with a basic Human need, that of self-preservation.

Though The Earth was no longer the only place on which Humans lived, the planet was more than &#039;Home&#039; for even those who had never seen, nor would ever see it. It was the fundamental hub, the symbolic cradle of the Human Race.

And they&#039;d messed it up.
