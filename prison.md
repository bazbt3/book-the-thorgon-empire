# Prison? {#prison}

Timmy needed a rest. His exertions while helping out, thinking he needed to perform as the Captain&#039;s son, had exhausted him. He&#039;d not ordered anyone about, not tried to show how special he was, but expected to have more work than given to the others.

One of the others had told him to &quot;Go and have a break! There&#039;s no point in rushing, tiring yourself out, we&#039;ve no idea how long we&#039;ll be here.&quot; And she was right.

&quot;Dad?&quot; he said, falling into a chair, &quot;Did you get any clues how long we&#039;re to be held here? And what are their plans? Will we have enough food? And--&quot;

A siren sounded, the lights dimmed and the viewscreen turned on.

&quot;Welcome, Humans. This presentation is designed to inform and educate you, to outline your new responsibilities as valued Thorgon subjects. Please sit down.&quot;

As everyone found somewhere to sit the narrator continued, &quot;No questions will be permitted. However, it will not be necessary to take notes, this recording will be made available on-demand later along with supporting materials.&quot;

&quot;As your civilisation will perhaps have basic rules to prevent a descent into chaos when exposed to various internal or external stimuli, so does ours. You will be expected to adhere to all rules to which a Thorgon must. That is we must follow. We Thorgons have a distinct advantage over races like yours, races we welcome into our sphere of influence; our entire lives from birth are governed by these rules. Think of it like a language, with often subtle, nuanced interactions between the rules. A native speaker has that advantage almost from birth.&quot;

Here a picture of a book appeared on the viewscreen.

&quot;This book is called &#039;The Thorgon Creed&#039;. It defines what we are and how we interact. As previously inferred you will be given some latitude, and rule transgressions will not be dealt with in the same manner of that applicable to Thorgons. Over time that will change. Why? We do recognise that The Creed can be the subject of a lifetime&#039;s study. And well, we are not monsters.&quot;

Most assembled laughed at that, with emotions spanning the range from genuine appreciation of the humour to a predictable sardonic response.

&quot;You will all be given a personal copy of The Creed. You will study it and live by it.&quot;

A photo of the now-stowed contents of one of the containers appeared on-screen.

&quot;You have food and medicines. Both will be insufficient to sustain you throughout the remainder of your lives. We have the means to grow your food and recreate your drugs, but your expertise will be necessary.&quot;

Some of the more perceptive looked around the room at this last statement, this revelation. The question &#039;How?&#039; hung in the air whilst they awaited the end of the monologue.

It ended simply enough.

&quot;You are free to leave this area. You must not enter the Command or the Security Rooms without permission. That is all.&quot;

The viewscreen darkened, to silence. The question &#039;What?&#039; now hung in the air, competing for attention with the recent &#039;How?&#039;

The stunned silence was broken by the muffled thuds of the door bolts being withdrawn.

&quot;Wellâ€¦&quot; was all Timmy could say.
