# Adjustments {#adjustments}

The post-attack phase of Thorgon conflict had no element of command- or crew-level self-congratulation, no feeling of relief. Not usually.

Indeed it was expected that, unless external and unexpected aggression caught them unawares, their superiority in numbers and tactics would prevail. Minor variations from the standard approach and a stealth when exploring new systems ensured continuing successes.

Snurf opened The Manual, selected ’Space &gt; Conflict &gt; Completed &gt; Opposing &gt; Disabled &gt; Races &gt;’ and paused. No ’Humans’ yet.

The crushing realisation arrived: the earlier orders ’observe, document, maintenance’ seemed at the time mundane, suited to his status. But how clever! His commander had shifted responsibility. The benefits to the vastly-more experienced officer were obvious now: if Snurf succeeded here, his name would not be put forward for honours or added to The Manual’s list of contributors; if Snurf failed it would be the end of Snurf’s military career.

He thought for a moment of simply giving up but, however much he wished for no more wormholes, bringing shame to his family just would not sit right. The sudden onset of a desire for revenge though there was no other way. His father obviously knew that a placement here would…

Without a strategy though, he would need help. But who here could he trust? He voiced the sound of this few moments of reflection before realising it had happened, &quot;Hmmm…&quot;

Something about the lower-ranked officer troubled him. Maybe it was the way she reacted to the senior officer&#039;s commands; maybe it was the way she appeared to be observing Snurf, but that could have been a military protocol for new officers. She was efficient though, and their commander didn&#039;t notice the same things Snurf had learned to over the years. He made a decision.

“Tlur?”

She looked across.

“How would you like an offer of a promotion?”

Her eyes narrowed, brow furrowed and in a low voice and, not so much as a question as the preamble to an upcoming negotiation: “You need help?”

Ignoring, rather than oblivious to, the tone, he waved his hand at the text, hoping the moment would pass: “Yes. No entry for Humans in The Manual. Recommendations?”

Not to be dissuaded: “Yes, of course.” And after the shortest of pauses: “…for the extra letter.”

Snurf made a show of ignoring the unexpected ambition of the other officer. He needed her expertise. “Let us begin.”

“First,” she began, “a sensor sweep for weapons&quot; then, grinning, “Contain debris, order assembly, close, cut a hole, extract only living personnel.” A telling pause and: “We are already closing on the Human ship, the crew of course have standing orders.”

“Of course.”

“However you must do the rest. Deal with the Humans. Sir.”

“Indeed. Implement your plan.”

“For the letter.”

He nodded, resigned to the inevitability of this onslaught.

Tlur activated the internal announcement channel: “Crew, the plan: The Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist will shortly instruct the vanquished to assemble close to the outside of their ship. You will net the near-range area for debris, erect containment then cut open the side and collect all the living beings. Then we kill their ship.”

“Oh, and a planet for whichever of you catches their leader. Don&#039;t fight over it.”

Everyone listening throughout the ship broke into spontaneous laughter. One day it would happen that a Thorgon crew member would win that prize. One day, just not today.

The cleanup began.

“Ok sir, your turn.”

“So it is.”

And, after examining the ship, he made his decision.

“Humans, assemble in the section of your transport with the large window currently facing my vehicle. If you have protection, wear it, exposure to space is unforgiving. Do not think of hiding, your transport will be destroyed soon. I repeat, it will be destroyed soon.”

He muted his pickup and, turning to Tlur: “Would you repeat that?”

“No. Too many words but it&#039;s usually wiser than fewer, given our Manual’s lack of ’Human’ guidance.”

Unmuting, “Go now,” his final command to the Humans.

A few minutes later, the focused life scan completed, the Out team cut away the Human ship window. Everyone who, but moments before, was safe inside the familiar habitat were scooped up by the Thorgon containment and collection nets and swiftly moved to the mothership.

“Report?”

“All going according to your plan sir, with the garbage collection due to start right about… now.” And, after a short time: “Are you recording?”

“Yes, of course. “ And with a rueful grin. “I must edit later.”

“Of course.”

“Thankyou.”

“Not now.”

Snurf watched the viewscreen, operated those sensors deemed safe-enough for him by his subordinates, and let the crew perform.

And then something unexpected happened, a something not predicted by The Manual, and entirely outside the previous protocols for such times.

That &#039;something&#039; began slowly, built gradually, proved… interesting to say the least.
