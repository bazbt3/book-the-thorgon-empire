# The Unfortunate Incident With The Toilet {#the-unfortunate-incident-with-the-toilet}

“Aw no, not again.” Not angry, not upset, not seeking someone or something to blame, no. It was the third time of asking, the third time failure stared Timmy in the face. He knew the family&#039;s reputation for tenacity would get him through the ordeal, but the still-too-recent laughter of his peers rang sharply in his ears.

A mandatory part of the training regime, turning off the gravity to simulate, well, the gravity being turned off, was great fun in training but less-so in the under-the-microscope of Ship’s examination conditions. Not only an entrance into the adult world of space exploration, but a coming-of-age ritual too. Necessary to progress out here.

He tumbled, uncontrolled, past the only window on this section of the ship. The inevitable replay of last time’s unfortunate events swam unbidden before his mind’s eye and he was back again, the same room but a week before. His gaze automatically drifted to the door, closed now, the remains of the biohazard tape still dangling there, mute testament to events best forgotten… events which gave him his unkindly-bestowed but appropriate nickname.

“Master Hadron,” came a voice made mechanical-sounding even without a suit: “concentrate.”

“Yes dad,” snapping out of it quickly: “Yes, Sir.”

“What can you do to extricate yourself from this unfortunate situation?”

Timmy processed the situation quickly. What was there? Nothing, save succumb to the inevitability of failure.

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot;

Timmy now had time. His thoughts became unpleasant. When his mother had left, his busy dad had lavished on him all the attention he could spare. When off duty Tim Hadron made sure they did everything together; name a sport, any outdoor activity, they at least tried it.

And they ate together, they tried pretty-much every planet-side cuisine available. It was of course necessary to replenish their energy. Of course it was. Of course dad encouraged it, for the down-time also gave both time to talk and to plan their future.

Thus Timmy’s dad had unwittingly set in motion a pattern that would define Timmy’s son’s early ship-side life. The rapid weight gain even before they joined the ship, a combination of its lower gravity with a lack of planet-side physical activities, it all took its toll.

Hadron II had not confessed to breaking the toilet, but while his dad certainly enjoyed having Timmy on board, Captain Hadron couldn&#039;t avoid the facts. That toilet didn&#039;t break itself and his son was the only one heavy enough to cause that much damage. He&#039;d have to teach him another lesson in responsibility. And reinforce the one on the difference between weight and mass.

It was how Timmy earned his nickname. One bestowed by his peers. It was not altogether unwarranted, not altogether unkind. It was &#039;The Large Hadron Collider.&#039;

At that specific memory, Timmy returned to the present.

The door loomed closer.
