# Airlock {#airlock}

Snurf knocked, &quot;Sir?&quot; He waited a respectful time before knocking again. &quot;Sir?&quot;

A muffled response, &quot;Come,&quot; and as Snurf entered, &quot;is it done?&quot;

&quot;Yes. The debris field is clear, the Humans are undergoing Orientation, the charges are set and my interim report is completed. The entry in The Manual is awaiting your approval, and…&quot; Snurf swallowed, &quot;the airlock maintenance is done, also awaiting your inspection.&quot;

The Vice-Sub-Snarglist rubbed his eyes, &quot;Good, good--&quot;

&quot;We should go now, whilst the Humans are contained the safety of your ship is something I am not prepared to compromise on. Especially given the expected blast wave as we destroy their vehicle, and…&quot;

The mocking response was deserved after the impertinence, but still hurt, &quot;Yes sir Ag-AckAck. Sir.&quot;

Snurf&#039;s resolve hardened, was just about airtight, iron-clad, and then his superior laughed.

&quot;Ag-AckAck, how would you like an offer of a promotion?”

Snurf groaned inwardly as thoughts of failure resurfaced; was it too late, would Tlur back down if he… and was the record adequately sanitised?

&quot;Yes sir, of course.&quot;

&quot;Consequent on my name in the Manual.&quot;

&quot;Well, obviously sir.&quot;

Snurf&#039;s path was now clear. He watched as the still-recovering superior slowly suited up, then, &quot;This way sir.&quot;

&quot;Lead.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir, I shall.&quot;

All the way to the airlock Snurf avoided eye contact with the crew lest they guessed the plan. As they arrived he walked into the loading bay first, not entirely according to protocol, but his previous order had been to lead…

&quot;Show me.&quot;

The Manual&#039;s airlock test procedure required a full-sized, empty transport container to be swung against the door; a test of seal integrity, pressure and strain sensor function, and whether the safety interlocks functioned as-designed. It was of course expensive if the door or the container was damaged beyond repair, one reason why the Space Safety Accounting Subcommittee continually looked unfavourably on this, instead advocating computer simulations.

The Engineer always looked forward to these tests though, a matter of professional pride, for both parents working for the container production company.

Tlur stood to one side of the door, checked her suit time readout and nodded.

The Engineer walked with the Vice-Sub-Snarglist to the opposite side of the container, and he released the latch holding the mass against gravity, &quot;One of the perks of command, and it&#039;s more fun than pressing buttons all day!&quot;

The container didn&#039;t disappoint, accelerating all the way to the door. A siren sounded, the lights all came on at once, and within a fraction of a second the whole ship shuddered as the container impacted the outer door.

Snurf&#039;s attention snapped to Tlur, now holding a dull metallic object against a non-contact safety sensor. He double-checked his tether was connected to one of the many fixtures around the walls.

The external disturbance had shifted the container&#039;s flight just-enough that it impacted the control board. The door shuddered against the twin impacts and shifted ever-so-slightly in its mounts. The inherent design flaw of a single electric control with a fragile non-interlocked mechanical swinging arm designed by committee, and Tlur overriding the proximity sensor, gave the computer all it required to open the door. Fast!

And then Snurf saw it. The Engineer had fastened the Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039;s tether to the container! Reaching the full extent of its length as the container neared the termination of its arc it snapped him towards the fast-opening door. As he reached it the speed of his flight increased along with the pull of the outrushing atmosphere. Those unequal and opposite reactions, of the container again swinging in and him swinging out, it could only mean one thing.

Despite now expecting the outcome, each of the three looked on aghast as their commanding officer frantically attempted to hold his suit together. Taking the precaution of disabling his medium-range priority communicator not only condemned him to a certain fate but spared the three later nightmares.

Then the pressure wave took him and he was gone.

&quot;Emergency! Commanding officer off ship, emergency scan!&quot; Very loud, very shrill inside his suit, Snurf shouted the alert.

Back to self-preservation. Tlur had evidently briefed the Engineer who, perhaps due to the inadequate preparation time, struggled to reach and activate the &#039;Close&#039; control. &quot;Done,&quot; nodding to Tlur, was all she said. Then at least.

It was done.

The door had closed, resealed, the bay repressurised, and it was soon safe to unsuit, not that they did.

&quot;What, how?!&quot; Snurf gasped as they ran to the command room, &quot;What, how?&quot;

&quot;Standard operating procedures sir,&quot; was all Tlur said.

&quot;Scan for his beacon! Scan for life! NOW!&quot; They were already doing it of course; no-one but the three would guess the outcome Snurf wanted. &quot;Anything?&quot;

&quot;Hold…&quot; then a puzzled. &quot;No signs of life but the beacon is inside the ship. Security, go to the Human containment section, follow the Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039;s beacon signal!&quot;

Shortly after the report came back, &quot;Nothing, he&#039;s not here. Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot;

To the command crew: &quot;Where else could he be? Quickly!&quot;

One suggestion came quickly, &quot;Outside, on the hull?&quot;

Tlur took over: &quot;Security, hull sweep, use a Collector!&quot;

The beacon signal proved more useful outside the ship and the Collector crews quickly located and retrieved the battered body.

&quot;Straight to the Med bay, start life support, we&#039;ll be right there.&quot;

&quot;Not much chance he&#039;s still… is there?&quot; Snurf wondered out loud.

Tlur again: &quot;Standard Operating Procedures sir.&quot;

After climbing out of their suits and on the short walk to the medical bay, the silence was broken only by Tlur&#039;s inquiry, “Are you ready for this?&quot;

&quot;What, a dead body? No!&quot;

&quot;No, the aftermath of this.&quot;

&quot;My father will be pleased. Surprised but pleased,&quot; he shuddered, and they entered the medical bay&#039;s airlock.

The ship&#039;s Chief Medical Officer greeted them after the regulation decontamination. Well not so much greeted as motioned them to enter, starting with &quot;He&#039;s dead. It&#039;ll be from either the effects of the rapid suit decompression or the massive blunt trauma forces as he impacted the hull. What should we do, autopsy, preserve for Home Planet interment? What?&quot;

&quot;What does The Manual say?&quot;

One of the medical staff checked. &quot;Nothing, the regulations surrounding the chain of command expect that a senior officer will not be exposed to any substantial danger,&quot; and, somewhat ruefully, &quot;that&#039;s what we&#039;re here for? We preserve then.&quot;

Another medic then asked. &quot;How did it happen?&quot;

A curt response: &quot;Freak accident. It&#039;ll all be in the report.&quot;

Tlur broke in, &quot;We need to convene the Succession Committee.&quot;

Everyone looked at her then at Snurf, knowing it was a formality, but all not relishing the prospect.

As they left, she whispered to the almost-Vice-Sub-Snarglist, &quot;An interestingly sudden field promotion wouldn&#039;t you say?&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; For there was not much else to be said about this.
