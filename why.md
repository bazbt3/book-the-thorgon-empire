# Why? {#why}

The following morning everyone awoke early. After breakfast, necessarily separated by virtue of the differences between their diets, they sat in clusters in their common room and chatted.

Seeing the Human Captain alone for once, the Vice-Sub-Snarglist crossed the room to him and sat.

&quot;Good morning Captain. How are you? I hope you slept--&quot;

Tim Hadron readied himself, &quot;I have just one question, it&#039;s something I&#039;ve been meaning to ask but, well, I shall now.&quot;

&quot;Go on Captain, if I can answer I will.&quot;

&quot;Why did the Thorgons attack all those years ago? Why did you attack us now?&quot;

&quot;Well…&quot; Snurf took a moment to make up his mind, and chose to trust the Human, &quot;The second part I can answer easily enough. I told the truth; the absolute truth is that we could not have returned home with your ship there. Our destruction of your ship left a tiny amount of matter scattered in the vicinity of the wormhole, but even if we had asked you to leave, the disturbances caused by your drive, not to mention the waste jettisoned as you left…&quot; At this he shuddered, &quot;And, well, I was not in command.&quot;

&quot;Not in command? Who was? And why not now?&quot;

&quot;I shall answer your second question first. It&#039;s… easier. Incidentally I wasn&#039;t even in the military then, my rise to command has been little faster than most.&quot;

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;2 days.&quot;

&quot;What, days?! Do you use the word differently to us?&quot;

&quot;No, a Thorgon Standard day is approximately three percent longer than your Earth Standard day. But thanks for allowing me to digress. With the help of my crew I simply replaced the previous Vice-Sub-Snarglist.&quot;

Snurf could see the Captain wanted more but he remained uncomfortable even thinking of the manner of the acquisition of rank. Before he had chance to change the subject the Humans did it for him.

&quot;Please tell me why the first attack happened.&quot;

&quot;It was unfortunate timing. Without our current capability to communicate with your systems, though not inevitable it was likely it wouldn&#039;t end well.&quot;

&quot;But you attacked first, without any warning. We were working out how best to approach you, cycling through the basic number systems in light and radio frequencies. We simply weren&#039;t ready.&quot;

Surprised, Snurf responded, &quot;No. One of your ship&#039;s initiated the conflict. I&#039;m surprised you didn&#039;t know.&quot;

&quot;No, that&#039;s not what we--&quot;

&quot;Yes. Though I&#039;m sure you know anything can be faked I can show you the analysis and the raw data. Not now unfortunately, it&#039;ll have to wait until we reach Thorgon Prime; this ship&#039;s Machine doesn&#039;t have a fast-enough link.&quot;

Tim Hadron closed his eyes and, keeping them shut, &quot;How long until we reach your home?&quot;

Snurf&#039;s communicator signal interrupted the conversation.

&quot;I must go, a priority message from home.&quot;

&quot;How long?&quot;

&quot;2, maybe 3 days.&quot;

Snurf headed to his personal room and opened the secure channel. A glance at the status line showed a 3 minute delay; useful communications would be at least possible. The message was part comforting, part worrying. It read:

&quot;1: Congratulations on your new command. Approved by Committee. Authenticate.

2: Divert to Planet 9, monitor and assist the Human arrival. Your cargo is no longer required on homeworld.&quot;

3: End.&quot;

Snurf composed a reply providing his authenticated acceptance, and asked for a detailed strategy before their arrival at Planet 9\. A mere 10 minutes later came the response.

&quot;1: Congratulations on your new command.

2: End.

Snurf would need help. He composed an alert to his command staff to meet in the… and changed it to add the Human senior staff. Being reunited with their people, though they would be complete strangers, might make them easier to… no, &#039;control&#039; wasn&#039;t the word he wanted to use.

&quot;Welcome everyone. I must be brief. I received new orders. We will go to Planet 9 and welcome the three arrivals from Earth. It seems we have a certain amount of autonomy, the, you Humans are no longer required on our homeworld. We should first recalculate how long our stores will last, then a flight plan, and then plan what we must do upon arrival. This ship will of course not be landing. Now, are there any questions?&quot;

There were of course questions, none of which Snurf could answer. Given the circumstances everyone in the room understood why.

Tlur walked in silence with him to the command room. Just before they arrived she asked, &quot;Have you ever seen a new world?&quot;

&quot;Only in the sandpit…&quot;

They went in, sat and waited for the report. When it came the summary was brief; current energy reserves were high-enough to reach Thorgon Prime, or to reach Planet 9 but not to return home, and they&#039;d have to restock the food. A small detour to an automated space station would be necessary. It would be years before Planet 9 had infrastructure in orbit for refuelling, and once the the Ark ships started the journey through the atmosphere to the surface of the world their power reserves were committed to planetary needs.

&quot;How long will this refuelling stop take?&quot; Commander V!lum asked, and then, &quot;And how long until we reach the planet?&quot;

After consultation Tlur replied, &quot;We don&#039;t know how long it will take to refuel, it&#039;s dependent on what we find when we arrive. Our best guess is 12 hours. However it will take approximately 17 hours to reach and dock with the refuelling station, and from there 22 hours until we establish a stable orbit around Planet 9\. This of course assumes we have calculated our needs accurately.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, do you not know--&quot; said V!lum.

Snurf broke in, &quot;We have no defined mission.&quot;

Everyone turned to face him.

&quot;I believe we might be called upon to assist the Ark ships&#039; safe arrival to the surface, and to monitor their communications until they reach their accommodation. We have planet-capable craft of course, but until our mission defines itself I wish to hold them back. Now when I say safe arrival I, er… they are not so much entry vehicles as Crashlanders.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Timmy blurted out.

&quot;The ship&#039;s have a one-way trip to the surface and, if all goes well, they&#039;ll slide to a halt not too far from their occupants&#039; new homes. Is that right?&quot;

&quot;Yes. As best as we can tell,&quot; Tlur replied.

&quot;Oh. Thanks. Do they know? The people?&quot;

&quot;We don&#039;t have that information.&quot;

Tim Hadron sighed, &quot;Can we help?&quot;

&quot;We don&#039;t know. Can you?&quot;

&quot;I… yeah, good question.&quot;

The ensuing laughter was a good point at which to close the meeting. As most of the procedures were automated once set there would be nothing to do until the refuel, and then the same nothing to do until reaching the planet.
