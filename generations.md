Tim interrupted his son’s work: “Would you like to go on a mission?”

“Do I have a choice? I mean dad, I do know what coming up in the training schedule.”

“Good point. I&#039;m impressed, that&#039;s quick.”

“That&#039;s me.”

“Do you remember son, when I explained how the stars work, how planets orbit and civilisations develop and then sometimes don&#039;t, how stars congregate together in galaxies, and--”

“And all I wanted to do was look up at the twinkling lights and coo?”

“You do. Good. Don&#039;t ever lose that sense of wonder when you get a command of your own. Don&#039;t let it cloud your judgment though, command is occasionally… difficult.”

He thought and then continued: “My dad gave me a good grounding in zero-gravity basics, you&#039;re doing just fine. In fact you&#039;re ahead of me in a lot of other disciplines, and I&#039;m certain your mo…”

“Dad?”

“Yes?”

“Shut up dad.”

At that everyone in the Command Module laughed, especially the proud father.

“Number One, check the long range sensors please, it&#039;s time to have some fun with the boy.”

Smiling: “Yes sir,” and, some time later: “Clear.” A pause: “Long-range scan is complete, and the wormhole is not exhibiting signs of impending portal activation.”

Quietly, “Number One, turn off the gravity please,” then even quieter, for his First Officer’s ears only: “and turn off the blowers, it&#039;ll spice things up a bit.”

Commander V!lum smiled, “Are you sure sir?”

“Yes, and please recheck the sensors, I…”

She first issued the computer the order to activate the wormhole. Never an easy task, the advance from the constant milestone checks required by version 6.0.6 to the precision of version 10.0.1 was very much welcomed.

Ultimately confident in her own abilities, her record unspotted, the Captain’s repeated request seemed odd but she had, over the years, become accustomed to Humans’ insecurities and inconsistencies, and their insight. The last attribute made no sense though, Humans are a mess.

Conciliatory, “Of course sir, I&#039;ll check again.” So she did. A short time later, “Unless our entire sensor field is faulty there are no signs of any abnormal disturbance at the gateway.”

Unspoken was the knowledge that the happened within and rhroigh the wormhole was at best a guess, a balancing of probabilities for even the most accomplished sensor operator. The last time any unsignalled ship had appeared here it didn&#039;t end well; the loss of life had been appalling, but then the incursion into Human-controlled space had been repulsed. Just.

She turned off the gravity. The viewscreen shifted focus, it shimmered. V!lum’s brow furrowed. “Sir--”

Captain Hadron screamed into the comm: &quot;GET THOSE BLOCKERS UP!&quot; But it was too late. The Thorgons had returned in even greater, this-time overwhelming, numbers. Their first shots took out the starlight drive, surely condemning the crew to a life in space. Maybe their grandchildren would see Earth?

A second strike sliced away a significant portion of the command module. Death awaited anyone unsuited.

Captain Hadron screamed again, wordless, hopeless. It was of course pointless in the vacuum of space, his transceiver gone, but he nonetheless screamed. And then, as the training kicked in, weakly: &quot;Parlay?”

The response, instant, as chilling as it was unexpected due to the loss of his radio: &quot;No. Destruction.&quot; Then, leaving just enough time for the reality of the situation to sink in, “We will take what we require then destroy your ship. You have a choice: our transportation or the eternity of space.”

At that the Vice-Sub-Snarglist muted all incoming communications and the outgoing channel to the Human.

“We have disabled the Human opposition with minimal loss of life. A success. Conflict 101, you might say.” He guffawed, inordinately pleased the permanent record would indicate, with the albeit-inadvertent reference to the First Item, his Adherence to The Creed. And, to mask his pleasure at the situation, soberly: “We were sloppy in making the unnecessary second strike. That must not happen again”

“Yes sir.”

“Recommendations?”

The lower-ranked officer thought for a moment, understandable given his lack of familiarity with standard operating procedures: “Contain and dispose of the debris field, order the opposition personnel to assemble in a surface module, close in, cut its side away, extract only the living.”

&quot;Aren&#039;t you forgetting…&quot;

Snurf though quickly, not wanting to prolong this, &quot;We should have our Collection crew bring over their food and meds and medical equipment?&quot;

“Good, good. One thing. Their metals, energy stores?”

“No need, we are at full capacity for this phase of the mission. We… you planned this mission well sir.”

“Very good. Destruction then.”

The Vice-Sub-Snarglist reactivated communications with the Human: “All Humans will leave your ship, which we will then cause to cease to exist.”

“You--”

The Thorgon muted both channels between him and the Human, turned to the lower ranked officer and on his way out of the room, ordered: “Take over. Implement.”

Surprised, given the change in orders: “Sir?”

“I must go and rest. And, Ag-AckAck…”

“Sir?”

“When it&#039;s done, fix the outer airlock.” And he was gone.

“Sir.”

A pause, a breath. Snurf opened the channels again and listened.

Almost inaudibly: “…kind of evil would…! How can I hear them, it&#039;s busted, it should be impossible!” Then louder: “Talk to me, you monsters, can we salvage nothing of value to us?!”

’Disbelief’, ’redemption’, ’family photo’: words almost-meaningless to the Thorgons. &#039;Destruction&#039; on the other hand: familiar, routine, comforting almost.

Tim Hadron, tired of shouting without any hope of a response, stared at the faceplate readout. He hated ultimatums, whether private or of planetary significance. Unfortunately the readout simply stared back.

The voice again startled him, “Human, it is time.”

Conscious of his responsibility to his ship and its inhabitants he responded in the only way possible, “Yes. Do it.”

The Thorgon mothership shifted position imperceptibly, in the manner of an immovable object resisting an irresistible object with a slightly unequal but certainly opposite reaction to itself. But it moved. Slowly.

Snurf looked over at Tlur and arched an eyebrow indicating his extreme impatience. In reality he wished for this phase to end so he could sleep; trips through wormholes took him hours to recover from.

Tlur pretended to examine the airlock remote readouts.
