# Committee {#committee}

&quot;The subcommittee to select the ship&#039;s interim replacement Vice-Sub-Snarglist is convened. Decisions are subject to ratification by the Personnel Selection Committee on Thorgon Prime, currently out of reach this close to the wormhole.

&quot;Present, representatives from Administration, Communications, Engineering, Galley/Housekeeping, Medical, Navigation, Security, Weapons, and myself. Machine, record the names, correct titles.

&quot;Also present, though in a silent, non-voting capacity, the single candidate, Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist Ag-AckAck Snurf.&quot;

Tlur looked around the table, continued, &quot;We are here to evaluate the candidate&#039;s suitability for the position then appoint, or not, as appropriate. No other business will be discussed due to the extraordinary nature of the situation in which we find ourselves.

To speed things along I am authorised to ask if there are any negative votes planned and, if not, to bypass the discussion phase and consider the appointment granted. A show of hands will in this case to be sufficient to conclude business.&quot; She looked around the table and breathed, &quot;Negative votes?&quot;

All but one shook their head, the surprising dissenter, the lone raised hand, the Chief Engineer.

Tlur had just one word: &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;He is a career civil servant, has no command or deep space experience or training, apart from during this appointment. I mean no disrespect by this, it must be recorded that I believe during this appointment the Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist has performed at command level. Simply put though, he is not yet proven. Can we trust our lives to his care?&quot;

Snurf nodded at the conclusion of a very fair summary. The Engineer caught the movement and turned towards him. &quot;Interesting, I expected a different response.&quot;

&quot;So did I,&quot; Snurf replied before remembering his silent, nonvoting place here.

Tlur asked, &quot;Motion to have the candidate&#039;s response be stricken from this record? Seconders?&quot;

None.

&quot;Vote on the appointment then? First, against?&quot;

None.

&quot;For?&quot;

Unanimous.

&quot;Carried. Let it be recorded that Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist Ag-AckAck Snurf is promoted to this ship&#039;s interim replacement Vice-Sub-Snarglist. Subcommittee business is concluded.&quot;

And that was that. The first to congratulate the new commanding officer? The Chief Engineer, her comment simply, &quot;Definitely not what I expected. Not a typical civil servant from what I&#039;ve seen.&quot;

&quot;Thankyou,&quot; he laughed, and then to himself, &quot;Perhaps my father did indeed see more?&quot;

&quot;He did,&quot; her puzzling reply.

To the Engineer, &quot;One question though, as you held my future so effectively in your grasp. Why?&quot;

Her somewhat enigmatic reply, &quot;Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right.&quot;

The room emptied.

To himself again, &quot;Now what?&quot; He checked the time. &quot;Bedtime. No, I can&#039;t… can I? Did I say that out loud?&quot;

Instead he walked to the command room to be greeted by a gruff, &quot;Shouldn&#039;t you be in bed sir?&quot; followed by an explosion of laughter from the crew behind. &quot;Really sir, a good night&#039;s sleep will help us all tomorrow. We head back home.&quot;

At that Snurf&#039;s heart dropped. The wormhole again. But he left for bed.

Entering his new quarters he was surprised to find no trace of its previous occupant. In the centre of the desk in front of him, a bar. Triangular in section, with smoothed-off corners and a colour suggesting tungsten. Etched on its visible side: &#039;Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039; and, in a shallow, almost imperceptibly-tiny font height below, his full name: &#039;Ag-AckAck Snurf.&#039;

Snurf hefted his bar, a comforting weight. Turning it over he found no other markings. Despite knowing of the leverage now held over him by whoever had removed his ambitious goal he smiled and decided to sleep, as ordered.

No sooner had Snurf&#039;s head hit the pillow than a knock at the door removed any illusion this would be an easy command.

&quot;Sir?&quot; It was Tlur.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Can we talk?&quot;

&quot;Wait, I&#039;ll need to dress again…&quot; hoping she&#039;d go, hoping to delay the inevitable.

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

He dressed and opened the door.

&quot;You don&#039;t remember me, do you.&quot; Tlur said quite matter-of-factly.

&quot;No. Should I?&quot;

&quot;It&#039;s true it was a long time ago, the last time I saw you and yes, I&#039;d hoped you would.&quot;

&quot;I&#039;m…&quot;, and after a while, &quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Do you remember the night The Snarglist was killed?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course! My life changed quite a--&quot;

She interrupted, &quot;How are Auntie Tlerj and Uncle Snurg?&quot;

&quot;They are very--&quot;

She interrupted again, &quot;And Gibflib? Is she…&quot;

The realisation arrived, &quot;Tlu.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Gibflib, no; I took her to the… Mother and father are… exactly the same. Slowing down a bit. I…&quot;

&quot;And how have you been?&quot;

&quot;Busy!&quot;

&quot;I seem to recall our conversations were a little longer back when--&quot;

It was Snurf&#039;s turn to interrupt, with a grin as the memories started to wash over him, &quot;We don&#039;t appear to be children any more.&quot;

&quot;True.&quot;

He checked the time. &quot;I should sleep and so should you, it&#039;s been… traumatic. We need to prepare for the…&quot;

&quot;Yes. Goodnight Snurf.&quot; And a moment later, &quot;Sir.&quot;

&quot;Goodnight Tlu. Tlur.&quot; A calculated pause, &quot;Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist.&quot;

The door closed softly as she left and despite, though perhaps because of the memories, he slept.
