# The Thorgon Empire {#the-thorgon-empire}

A first novella, a major story of intergalactic intrigue, aliens, destruction, deaths, sex, all of it set across the ages. And mutual cooperation in the face of adversity. And sex.

Well, the sex already happened in the unwritten prequel, but it happened, be sure of it.  One of the main protagonists wouldn't be in the book without it. In fact none of them would, the aliens aren't *that* alien. Logic, see!

Book 2, the sequel, will have plenty of sex, oh yes.
