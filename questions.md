&quot;As stated in my order we will take what we require then destroy your vessel, once our sensor and debris sweep is completed. Tell me, what are its energy storage and containment capabilities?&quot; Snurf looked up from his written instructions, the Human still emerging into his first Thorgon ship.

&quot;What? You expect me to give you our starship drive specifications, just like that?!&quot; Incensed, Hadron continued, &quot;I…&quot; then his eyes narrowed, an awful realisation dawning, &quot;No.&quot;

Though inexperienced in military matters the Thorgon, an effective negotiator, drove home his order, &quot;Yes. It serves two purposes: First,&quot; nodding towards the airlock, &quot;your people will continue to live a normal lifespan and second, we must know the blast radius.&quot;

&quot;Well, if my transceiver worked I could instruct the ship computer, if it&#039;s still operational, to make the data available.&quot;

Snurf turned, &quot;First Officer, turn off the short-range comms filter.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Tlur responded, wondering about the unexpected title, then, &quot;Done.&quot;

&quot;Done.&quot; Snurf repeated.

Hadron briefly considered transmitting the autodestruct codes before the realisation of its futility in the face of the plan the Thorgon had already stated twice. He tapped his transceiver and started to instruct the computer to transfer the basic power characteristics before pausing. &quot;Er… What&#039;s the use, you won&#039;t be able to decode this anyway.&quot;

&quot;Transmit, we can.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;We can. Do it.&quot;

So Hadron asked the computer, realising the enemy must have known about the ship&#039;s architecture before the strike. The computer complied.

Snurf turned again, &quot;First Officer, restore the short-range comms filter.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Tlur responded again, now realising her unexpected title was a field promotion, at least until the return of the Vice-Sub-Snarglist, &quot;Done.&quot;

&quot;Next, we have collected everything we can from your food and medical stores. You will tell us how to store them. Do you know?&quot;

Hadron snorted then reconsidered, &quot;No. I will need to speak to my crew.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;But what are you taking from my ship? Weapons, fuel, alloys, what?&quot;

&quot;Next, how many of breeding age are, were on board your ship?&quot;

&quot;What?! No, answer my question!&quot;

The Thorgon looked over at Tlur and, reminding her of their recent assignment, &quot;Is the loading bay outer airlock door maintenance completed?&quot;

&quot;No sir, the attack quite naturally took precedence over what was previously deemed non-essential maintenance.&quot;

&quot;We must find time then, when the Human&#039;s,&quot; he paused, &quot;when the Human&#039;s evaluation is terminated.&quot;

Hadron, quite naturally given the gravity of the present situation, took longer than a moment to process the implications. Though relieved of command of his ship he still had an duty to his crew and its passengers. What he did next would likely determine all their fates.

&quot;Well?&quot; The Thorgon interrupted the Human&#039;s thoughts without waiting for evidence of alertness, &quot;How many breeders?&quot;

&quot;I… don&#039;t know. It&#039;s not a question I&#039;ve ever been asked before. Not relevant to my command. Why did you ask?&quot;

Snurf filed that response away. Actually, though every response was being recorded, he was following his Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039;s orders, &#039;observe, document, maintenance.&#039;

His rapidly-coalescing plot contained an important prerequisite: the removal of his superior officer and the addition of his name to The Manual. Until that happened though, he must adhere to documented orders.

To usurp command was not entirely without precedent. This apparent conflict with other Items of The Creed could be swept away by one: &#039;Item 601 of The Thorgon Creed: Examine the past, compare its norms unfavourably with those of the present.&#039;

The Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist&#039;s focus snapped back to the problem immediately in front of him. Time was running out. &quot;Human,&quot; he leant forward, &quot;I already spoke to your son, but need you to say it. What is your title and full name, family first?&quot;

Sarcastically: &quot;Not my serial number too?&quot;

&quot;No, it is irrelevant here. Respond.&quot;

&quot;Captain, Hadron, Timothy.&quot;

The data confirmed, the Thorgon commanded, &quot;Order your crew to be ready for restraint fitting then movement to your new quarters. More detailed instructions will follow during your Orientation.&quot; He looked across to Tlur, who nodded. &quot;Human. Dismissed.&quot;

Further attempts at dialogue by Captain Hadron were rebuffed. He thought of staying to observe his captors but concluded it best to check on his crew&#039;s status. He turned back and walked through the still-open ship-side airlock door. As it closed and sealed he removed the mask and placed it in the slot.

The door ahead opened to a chaotic scene, in sharp contrast to the calm of the command room. From shouted variations on &quot;Do we have to put these on?&quot; through &quot;What are these infernal things?&quot; through to &quot;Hello again dad.&quot;

&quot;Son, they have our food and meds, that&#039;ll allow us to check our injured and find a way of stopping the food from spoiling. They&#039;ll have quarters prepared, but their Captain mentioned &#039;Orientation.&#039; Any ideas?&quot;

&quot;Nope, but it sounds like the first day at a new school.&quot;

&quot;Heh! Great analogy son, we&#039;ll use it as just that, our first day at…&quot;

A siren blared, all the lights came on at once. The door opened.

&quot;Humans, enter the inner airlock. Masks will be unnecessary.&quot;

All looked to the Captain. &quot;Yes.&quot; following up with an uncharacteristically imprecise, &quot;We need our stuff.&quot; At the wry looks from those closer to him he shrugged: &quot;Do you see my rank insignia?&quot;

Despite the unknown ahead, most laughed.
